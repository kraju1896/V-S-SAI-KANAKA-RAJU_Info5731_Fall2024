        "Overview\n",
        "\n",
        "This project implements an advanced Python program to manage inventory records for a product management company. The system allows users to perform various operations such as adding, deleting, updating products, searching, and auto-restocking. The inventory data is stored and managed using CSV files to ensure data persistence. Additionally, the program provides a category breakdown report showing item values for different product categories.\n",
        "\n",
        "Key Features\n",
        "\n",
        "Add Products: Allows adding new products with unique IDs.\n",

        "Delete Products: Removes products from the inventory.\n",
        "\n",
        "Update Products: Modifies product details like price and quantity.\n",
        "\n",
        "Search Products: Enables searching by product name or category.\n",

        "Auto-Restock: Automatically refills low-stock products.\n",

        "Restocking when no products need restocking → Should indicate no changes.\n",

        "Conclusion\n",
        "\n",
        "This inventory management system provides a structured approach to handling product records efficiently. It includes robust error handling, an automated restocking mechanism, and a reporting feature to track inventory value. By implementing edge cases and debugging with clear comments, the system ensures reliability and scalability for real-world applications.\n",

        "The first three questions were easy to solve and fourth and fifth questions made me think a bit, but I was able to solve them pretty good. Questions 6 and 7 were like mini projects which excited me a lot by changing the prompts and engaging with the GPT and making me give the expected code. While solving questions 6 and 7, dealing with 10 different edge cases was a difficult task. It would be easy to write few edge cases but finding 10 was a bigger task. It would be helpful if there was much time provided for completing the assignment."
