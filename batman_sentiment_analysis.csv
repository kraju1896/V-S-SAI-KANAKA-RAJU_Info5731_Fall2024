"This film is superb, in fact as Shakespeare once said ""Its the bees' knees"". The film captivates the audience from the beginning. Each of the twelve jurors are introduced to us as they are introduced to themselves. The characters are well draw out and individual, each with his own personality.

The tension of the characters draws the audience in from the start. We imagine that the case is open and shut, 11 me saying guilty and 1 not. We feel the discomfort of Henry Fonda as the other characters belittle and mock how he can see any reasonable doubt in the case. But we also share his victories and the enthusiasm as he proceeds to refute or add doubt to the arguments for guilty and are captivated and draw in as other jurors begin to see doubt in the proceedings.

The audience can also see the arguments for guilty and wonder if Fonda's character is correct in saying that he doubts. Yet they also feel the shame of the characters as he disproves that a previously sound theory is iron tight, joining his side as members of the jury do.

On top of this they are wonderfully woven in human elements such as the misconceptions that influence people and the growing tension between different characters. This is brought to life even more by the amazing performances, Fonda, Lee J Cobb and Joseph Sweeney are of particular note.

I started watching this film on a bored relaxed laying about day but by the end i was on the edge of the seat with my hands on my knees feeling more tense than a politician on results day.

"This film is investing from start to finish. None of the performances feel like actors playing characters, but instead as people who just happen to be being filmed. The dialogue is phenomenal, the camerawork is absolutely phenomenal, the heat and claustrophobia of the environment sets in right away and gradually gets more and more intense.

"12 Angry Men is a terrific film that reflects a lot of the past problems and the proposed solutions of immigration, youth violence, and of course, overcoming one's own background and discrimination. The film surprised me in how progressive it was, and the ending social conclusions that it reached.

In the film you can see clearly form a rift between the upper class, conservatives who are unwilling to change and the progressives who are proposing change for the better of all of us; this film, deep down, is a very class conscious and socially conscious film about discrimination and the deep lines it had in American society in 1957.

Although the film's portrayal is sometimes overly simplistic, drawing a ""stubborn, pig-headed"" conservative versus ""righteous, just"" progressive, one can find that this was very much so a necessary film for its' time. In many ways, it is a work that was socially far advanced.

Also what is interesting is the fact that it is a film that is done with great simplicity; some actors, and a room... It relies greatly upon the pure talent of the actors, and the great direction of Sidney Lumet -- this film is truly unique due to the true minimalism it embraces in its' production tactics, yet this is something that could easily go unnoticed due to the incredible quality of the film.",angri men terrif film reflect lot past problem propos solut immigr youth violenc cours overcom one background discrimin the film surpris progress end social conclus reach in film see clearli form rift upper class conserv unwil chang progress propos chang better u film deep class consciou social consciou film discrimin deep line american societi although film portray sometim overli simplist draw stubborn pighead conserv versu righteou progress one find much necessari film time in mani way work social far advanc also interest fact film done great simplic actor room it reli greatli upon pure talent actor great direct sidney lumet film truli uniqu due true minim embrac product tactic yet someth could easili go unnot due incred qualiti film,Positive
"Intense courtroom drama which has 12 very different people, all males, struggling with a murder case involving a young Puerto Rican boy that seems cut-and-dried. However, juror Henry Fonda does not believe it to be as sure-fire as it appears. He votes not guilty and what follows is a chain of events that will test the views, beliefs and thoughts of the other 11 members. Fonda is great, but Lee J. Cobb steals every scene (and that is not easy to do in a film like this). Ed Begley, Martin Balsam, Jack Warden, Jack Klugman, Joseph Sweeney, E.G. Marshall and John Fiedler are among the other individuals caught in a situation that is much more difficult than it appears on the surface. An excellent character-study that should be studied and embraced by all present and future film-makers. 5 stars out of 5.",intens courtroom drama differ peopl male struggl murder case involv young puerto rican boy seem cutanddri howev juror henri fonda believ surefir appear he vote guilti follow chain event test view belief thought member fonda great lee j cobb steal everi scene easi film like ed begley martin balsam jack warden jack klugman joseph sweeney eg marshal john fiedler among individu caught situat much difficult appear surfac an excel characterstudi studi embrac present futur filmmak star,Positive
"There are a few wonderful courtroom dramas out there, Anatomy of a Murder, To Kill a Mockingbird and Witness for the Prosecution immediately springing to mind. 12 Angry Men is so brilliant, it could very well be the definitive courtroom drama on film. Sidney Lumet's direction is masterly, and although the action takes place on one set(an actual New York drawing room) there are a huge variety of innovative camera angles and visual set-ups. The screenplay is sophisticated and smart, and the story is compelling and intelligent. The film is also brilliantly made, and the acting is superb. Henry Fonda especially dominates the film, with an integrity that makes his character so wonderful, but the other actors are wonderful as well, Ed Begley, Jack Warden, John Fiedler, Lee J Cobb, Rudy Bond et al. are all impeccable support to Fonda.

"Gosh, I don't know how many times I studied this play and performed it in high school, not to mention how many television shows had an episode that was inspired by 12 Angry Men. It was always a great drama because of the raw human emotions that were so true and remain timeless, this play will never be dated. I couldn't wait to see this movie when I saw it at the video store and it was the first movie I slipped into the DVD player. First off, I was incredibly impressed with the credits, we not only had Henry Fonda, we had Lee J. Cobb in the cast! This movie was so well performed and such a treasure, god, I couldn't ever say any words to justify it. I've done this a million times, but here is another summary of what 12 Angry Men is all about.

12 jurors are about to make a decision about a murder case, over all it seems like an open and shut case with tons of evidence that would make any good man look guilty, an 18 year old boy is about to be put to death if convicted. 11 of the men vote guilty, only one vote holds them back and they have to discuss the trial once again due to one vote being not guilty. Jurour #8 refuses to just jump to conclusions and brings up incredible possibilities that can always make a man think of ""reasonable doubts"", one by one the jurors begin to see the points he is making, except for one stubborn #3 who would rather just pull the switch to the chair himself.

12 Angry Men is a timeless tale that could either be told very badly, i.e. 7th Heaven, or incredibly well and bring out terrific performances like Henry and Lee did. Actually, the whole cast was terrific, there wasn't a performance that was off key, movies like this are so needed in Hollywood today, it was so simple, but added so much for a 30 minute play. Please, if you have any taste, you will truly enjoy 12 Angry Men and have a great appreciation for it!

"This is one of those movies where everything could go wrong. The story is as simple as it can be: 12 men are jurors on a open and shut murder trial, but one man thinks that another persons life deserves at least some thought on the matter and votes not guilty. From this point on we have 12 actors and a closed room. This could be the most boring film ever made. Lumet however is a master of mise-en-scene and provides a tense movie that keeps you locked on from the word ""go"". The dialogs are great and supported by incredibly talented actors. Joel Schumacher in Phone Booth needed to see this movie and draw a few ideas on how to make a character built, dialog driven movie.

"I could go on, but I thought I'd stop there before my summary line gets too big. Now just because this is a classic movie (and we really should try to use that term lightly, but this movie really deserves it and I'll elaborate on that), does not mean everybody will love it. And if one does not like it, it does not mean they have no taste. They just have different tastes, which is a good thing, because if every human on earth would have the same taste, life would be very boring now wouldn't it? The asnwer is yes, in case you were wondering.

But back to this, which begins outside and takes us inside. And it is important that we were outside because we will live inside a building (a room to be more specific) for the most time. There is also a brief shot of the alleged culprit/criminal. After that we get in a room with 12 men, who are quite different from each other. And while it wasn't yet time to give African American a chance in a movie like that (or Asian American for that matter), there is a critical racial line that is drawn. If you follow what is happening and who says what or argues in certain ways, you will see that this movie has quite the social commentary in it.

Now that is one part of this being genius, because it never rubs your nose in it. It never says, this guy who is i.e. from Italian descent has a reasonable thing/argument to say. No you just hear the things and see the people interact. And I have not even mentioned the way the movie is shot. And I'm not talking about the black and white cinematography (which is beautifully lit), no. I mean the framing and the set-ups. the editing and how everything flows. You feel like you're inside the room. You feel like this really happens or happened. Even the things that seem not staged (someone blocking another person, a shadow, peoples back and more) are in fact staged and masterfully done so.

There are way smarter people than me, that can list you many things this movie has done right and I'm sure there quite a few sources online to look for. Just listening to the audio commentary can give a small glimpse into certain things too. But again, since this is not something that one might call light entertaining, if it does not appeal to you, then it is so. It does not mean you are wrong and it surely does not mean that this movie is falsely considered a masterpiece!",i could go i thought id stop summari line get big now classic movi realli tri use term lightli movi realli deserv ill elabor mean everybodi love and one like mean tast they differ tast good thing everi human earth would tast life would bore wouldnt the asnwer ye case wonder but back begin outsid take u insid and import outsid live insid build room specif time there also brief shot alleg culpritcrimin after get room men quit differ and wasnt yet time give african american chanc movi like asian american matter critic racial line drawn if follow happen say argu certain way see movi quit social commentari now one part geniu never rub nose it never say guy ie italian descent reason thingargu say no hear thing see peopl interact and i even mention way movi shot and im talk black white cinematographi beauti lit i mean frame setup edit everyth flow you feel like your insid room you feel like realli happen happen even thing seem stage someon block anoth person shadow peopl back fact stage master done there way smarter peopl list mani thing movi done right im sure quit sourc onlin look just listen audio commentari give small glimps certain thing but sinc someth one might call light entertain appeal it mean wrong sure mean movi fals consid masterpiec,Positive

"This film deserves to be on anyone's list of top films. My problem is that it is so perfect, so seamlessly polished, it is hard to appreciate the individual excellences.

The acting is top notch. I believe that monologue acting is quite a bit simpler than real reactive ensemble acting. Most of what we see today is monologues pretending to be conversations. But in this film, we have utter mastery of throwing emotions. Once the air becomes filled with human essence, it is hard to not get soaked ourselves as the camera moves through the thick atmosphere. Yes, there are slight differences in how each actor projects (Fonda internally, Balsam completely on his skin...) but the ensemble presents one vision to the audience.

The writing is snappy too. You can tell it was worked and worked and worried, going through several generations. It is easy to be mesmerized by this writing and acting, and miss the rare accomplishment of the camera-work. This camera is so fluid, you forget you are in one room. It moves from being a human observer, to being omniscient, to being a target. It is smart enough to seldom center on the element of most importance, so expands the field to all men.

This is very hard. Very hard, to make the camera human. So much easier to do what we see today -- acknowledge the machinery and jigger with it. Do we have a filmmaker today who could do this?

"The plot of12 Angry Men revolves around the murder trail of a Latino boy who is accused of killing his father. The conviction of the boy would mean a death sentence and the destiny of the boy's life is in the hands of twelve male jurors of ranging personalities. The case seems open and shut with a murder weapon and several witnesses to place the boy at the scene of the crime. For eleven of the jurors the decision is apparent that the boy is guilty but for one juror, Mr. Davis (Henry Fonda), the boy's life should entail some discussion to eliminate any reasonable doubt the jurors may have. As the film progresses the personalities of the jurors become apparent and many underlying issues influence the guilty decision chosen by the majority of the jurors.

The underlying issues are the complexity of the personalities of the jurors and the reasons why they have the motivation to feel and act the way they do. As the case unfolds further, more is learned about each juror individually. The personalities range from being a short-tempered loud mouth to a straight- laced accountant who never breaks a sweat. As the movie progresses much more is learned of the characters that exposes the intricacy of human nature and people's different personality traits.

This film is an excellent example of movie making that does not require elaborate sets to entertain the viewer. The majority of the film takes place in a jury room with the men never leaving the room from their deliberation responsibilities. The cast and dialogue make this film memorable and the film has some clear moral issues that are addressed. The main issue is that not everything is as it seems. With further analysis the understanding of a situation becomes more concrete enabling the men to make a solid decision that affects a young man's life. 12 Angry Men is a classic film that should not be missed.",the plot angri men revolv around murder trail latino boy accus kill father the convict boy would mean death sentenc destini boy life hand twelv male juror rang person the case seem open shut murder weapon sever wit place boy scene crime for eleven juror decis appar boy guilti one juror mr davi henri fonda boy life entail discus elimin reason doubt juror may a film progress person juror becom appar mani underli issu influenc guilti decis chosen major juror the underli issu complex person juror reason motiv feel act way a case unfold learn juror individu the person rang shorttemp loud mouth straight lace account never break sweat a movi progress much learn charact expo intricaci human natur peopl differ person trait thi film excel exampl movi make requir elabor set entertain viewer the major film take place juri room men never leav room deliber respons the cast dialogu make film memor film clear moral issu address the main issu everyth seem with analysi understand situat becom concret enabl men make solid decis affect young man life angri men classic film miss,Neutral

"This film is my submission as the greatest ensemble cast performance in the HISTORY of CINEMA! As it was released when I was only 9 years old.... I have viewed it on multiple occasions... But to be honest, I cannot remember exactly when I saw it for the first time!

I must admit that the intricacies of jury duty selection in the New York area in the 1950's is something of which I know absolutely nothing about.... But I have often wondered if women, for some reason, were exempt from jury duty in New York 65 years ago!?!?!?

Leaving that issue aside, let's focus on the film itself. Some of the actors in the cast, like Henry Fonda, Lee J. Cobb and Ed Begley, were already well known when it was released in 1957. For Most of the others, their participation in this Classic certainly augmented their stature greatly! Although 12 ANGRY MEN was Nominated for Best Picture, Best Director and Best Adapted Screenplay, This Number 6 Highest Rated Movie of ALL-TIME, sadly, struck out at the Oscars... Winning nary a single Golden Statuette! I invite any and all of You reading my Review to focus on each and every astounding characterization rendered in this movie. With each viewing, I have come to appreciate and savor every detail, of every performance, all the more!

As someone who has seen thousands of movies, 12 ANGRY MEN lets You totally get into the head of each and every character... As almost no other film, before or since! 12, layer by layer, methodically peels away the facade that is part and parcel of our subconcious self-protection and insulation from letting ourselves become too vulnerable and over-exposed to scrutiny by others!

If You have never seen 12 ANGRY MEN... for whatever reason... or reasonS... You must place it at the very TOP of Your WATCH LIST! If perhaps, You saw it once, twice...or even three time, many years ago... I beseech You to revisit it!

"Shot in real time, this story of a jury trying to decide whether a young man is innocent or guilty never lets the viewer's attention go. Henry Fonda plays Juror #8, who is convinced the entire time that the defendant is innocent, while everyone else has already called him guilty. Throughout the movie, we not only get to hear everyone's opinions on the matter, but also every possibility of the verdict. With ""12 Angry Men"", Sidney Lumet brought to the screen the same kind of ""closing in"" feeling that he brought to movies like ""Network"". In the end, the issue is not whether the defendant is innocent or guilty; the important point is the process by which the jurors reached their decision.

"12 Angry Men may be the greatest film of the 1950's. It really is unlike other films, as it's takes place in mostly 1 location, over an hour and a half, and there's no actions - just a conversation. The acting just feels so natural, almost like they improvised the entire film. All the characters are distinct, and very memorable, especially juror 8.

Ultimately, the film is all about influencing a group, and how everything at face value shouldn't be taken for fact. Juror number 8, despite talking the least, has the most influence over the group. Everything that seems a fact, the eyewitness seeing the kid through the passing El train, can be rexamined, and twisted. The film shows the jurors to be tribalistic, and how some of the jurors' mostly strongly held beliefs are also their least challenged.

"Eleven to one, there is one enter dissenter among the Jury in the trial of a young man who's accused of murdering his father.

This for me is one of the greatest films of all time, it somehow never suffers as the years go past. Twelve men from different backgrounds, with different view points come together, their mission, to determine the guilt of one young man, it's an amiable start, but soon tempers begin to fly as the status quo is questioned.

I love that we're in for the kill as it were, we see no crime, or anything associated, everything we get is given to us by The Jurors, it is an incredible way of telling the story, I can't think of any other film that took this unique approach,

It scrutinises the many weaknesses people have, prejudices, preconceived ideas, anger and personal grievance, but it's balanced out by showing the exact opposite, bravery, faith, intelligence, the ability to listen and question. This film ranks as one of the best studies of human nature in existence.

If you've done jury service you'll relate to it, you have people that want to question, and you have people that want to get out of there and on with their lives as quickly as possible.

It's incredible to think of a time when Juries consisted of twelve whits men, it would have taken a brave man to be a single disagreeing voice.

"""12 Angry Men"" A chamber film about self-discovery.

""They have twelve pieces of paper... Twelve chances to kill!"" - tagline and the only thing I knew about the film. And that's what I'd like to shoot!

I love when the essence of the film sounds in the ""background"". We watch the jury deliberate on whether the boy is guilty of murdering his father, and we see each character's soul unfold. Based on emotions, thinking about the case by the words of his life problems, almost every character builds a monument of his character and breaks it into pieces. Juror 9's monologue about an old man who, at 79 years old, just wants to be heard, gets me every time. And with all prof. Deformation, I forget that I'm watching a movie.

And if you watched the movie and are waiting for comments about the case itself, facts and evidence - I have nothing to say. Many people have already done it for me. I remembered only people who reveal the truth in themselves by spending an hour talking to strangers.

"This movie is *not* a courtroom (or jury room) drama. It's about how a jury room can become a sanctuary that changes the lives of the jurors. It heavily implies that any place could become a place of metamorphosis if we only dug deeper with each other regarding each other's thoughts and beliefs.

"This movie came out of an era that I really loved, when ensemble acting was so strong. We had a whole group of character actors who really took seriously the smaller roles that they had. The direction by Sidney Lumet on this film is outstanding. To take the Henry Fonda character from the meek, inconsequential juror, simply putting forth a theory, to watching the other men slowly see his way of thinking, is subtlety at its best. Lee J. Cobb does his burn, done in by impatience and inconvenience. Pusing an agenda that fits only him. Underlying the entire plot is the defendant whom we never see but get to know through a slow, methodical, yet fascinating series of revelations.

"A dissenting juror (Henry Fonda) in a murder trial slowly manages to convince the others (Jack Klugman , Martin Balsam , Jack Warden , Lee. J. Cobb , Ed Begley , E.G. Marshall , Robert Webber , among others) that the case is not as obviously clear as it seemed in court. As Juror #8 holds out with a verdict of not guilty, thus setting the stage for arguments and reasons why or why not the boy may be guilty . As he desperately seeks to convince his eleven peers to reconsider their hast conviction of a boy framed of murdering . As 12 jurors are struggling to decide the fate of a teenager who allegedly killed his father .

Made for television classic about twelve jurors quick to condemn a youth on trial for murdering his father before reviewing the evidence. Though the whole movie is set in a jury room it never lacks for taut , suspense , intrigue and inspired direction . The struggle behind closed doors is tense , charged and riveting . Reginald Rose's brilliant TV play script was left virtually intact in its move to feature film. This famous play from the 'Golden Age of Television' was splendidly directed by Sidney Lumet with an extraordinary plethora of actors who give magnificent performances .Because the painstaking rehearsals for the film lasted an exhausting two weeks, filming had to be completed in an unprecedented 21 days and shot in a total of 365 separate takes. However, nowadays none of the twelve stars are still alive . The acting level of the cast during some of the intense discussions and debates almost bursts in the screen . The movie is commonly used in business schools and workshops to illustrate team dynamics and conflict resolution techniques. Nominated for 3 Oscars , another 16 wins & 6 nominations ; the film lost out in all its categories to The Bridge on the River Kwai . It ranked #2 on the American Film Institute's list of the 10 greatest films in the genre ""Courtroom Drama"".

This Lumet's impressive debut was followed by a remake made for cable TV (1997) , a contemporized rendition of the memorable tale whose script has been slightly updated but the premise is the same , it was directed by William Friedkin with a formidable cast such as William L. Petersen, Edward James Olmos, Hume Cronyn, James Gandolfini, Dorian Harewood, Ossie Davis, and Courtney B. Vance , George C. Scott , Armin Mueller-Stahl , Tony Danza and Jack Lemmon takes on the voice of dissent , the Fonda role .

"I agree with many of the reviews- less is more, great cast of actors. Love the premise of just following the jury in the room. Honestly after the first 30 minutes you could kind of tell where this story line was headed and it wasn't much of a surprise at the end. I just don't see this movie in the same league as some of the others at the top of best movie lists- Shawshank, Godfather, Schindler's list, even Pulp Fiction. It's not just because it is a classic black and white movie, I love that about it. It's a Wonderful Life blows this away. I will have to watch it again one day and see if I have a different opinion since everyone else seems enthralled with this movie.

"A young ethnic kid from a rough area is up on a murder charge and to the jury of twelve men, it all seems a fairly open and shut case. So all are surprised when the votes come back with one ""not guilty"" in the pack. Juror #8 maintains he holds a reasonable doubt, much to the frustration of the rest of the group. The stalemate forces a debate over the details of the case which sees each man questioning others and themselves for their motivations and decisions. The heat in the room and the passage of time sees tensions rising by the minute.

I'm not a massive fan of the ""Movie You Must See"" podcast crew because they mostly tend to discuss the events in a film rather than really critiquing or reviewing it (although at times this ""mates in a pub"" approach is OK). Anyway, one of the advantages of having anyone pointing out ""films you should see"" is that it reminds you that you should these films. So it was for me as I listened to 12 Angry Men and realised that not only had I never reviewed it but that I had not actually watched it for many years. Of course mentally I knew it was a ""classic"" but did I really understand why it was? So when it came on television recently I watched it again with new eyes.

The films moves right into the jury room and pretty much this room is all we have for the duration. Initially the script does really well to have the viewer side with the majority because in the discussions the evidence does seem very clear cut and #8's doubts seem so general and non-specific. This is a good way to start because it means the viewer also has to question and we are taken along the journey just like the men in the jury. Gradually we get into the detail and doubts are tweaked out  not to the point of solving the crime because that is not what it is about but it is done in a way that is interesting and engaging. It is not perfect in this regards though because some of the jumps are big, some of the assumptions are stretching and some of the knowledge in the room is a little too convenient. However what weaknesses there are in the material are covered by the fact that the delivery is roundly quite brilliant.

Lumet directions from within the room and makes great use of such a small space. It feels like it could be a play (not sure if it was or not) but Lumet prevents this just feeling like filmed theatre. The camera captures the room, sticks close to characters, moves around, in and out accordingly and it never feels stiff. This aids the sense of tension from the audience point of view as we are not just left watching the room so much as being in it. The ensemble cast are another big factor in this delivery as they all deliver. On the surface of it the characters could easily be labelled ""racist"", ""old"", ""naïve"", ""angry"" and so on but the actors don't let themselves be that basic and they also do a good job of pacing the building resentment and tension in the room to be convincing. Fonda maybe has ""top-billing"" but he does have the least showy role, leading those into his corner. Cobb and Begley have good turns as the anger of the room but everyone plays their parts very well. OK Balsam, Webber and Voskovec come out the least memorable of the lot but this is understandable when viewed beside such sterling turns from Fielder, Klugman, Warden, Sweeney and Marshall. There really isn't a weak link in the room.

With modern cynical eyes it is perhaps totally hard to accept the film for its praise of the jury system and I do agree with the ""MYMS"" group when they made reference to the moment in H:LOTS which is essentially the bitter reverse of this film. However this slightly flag-waving stuff is covered by the delivery being as strong and as well paced as it is. Overall then this is an eminently watchable film and I can understand why it is so well regarded. The material and message may not be note-perfect but the delivery is brilliant across the board and it is one that I could easily return to again and again and still get pleasure out of how well it is all done.",a young ethnic kid rough area murder charg juri twelv men seem fairli open shut case so surpris vote come back one guilti pack juror maintain hold reason doubt much frustrat rest group the stalem forc debat detail case see man question other motiv decis the heat room passag time see tension rise minut im massiv fan movi you must see podcast crew mostli tend discus event film rather realli critiqu review although time mate pub approach ok anyway one advantag anyon point film see remind film so i listen angri men realis i never review i actual watch mani year of cours mental i knew classic i realli understand so came televis recent i watch new eye the film move right juri room pretti much room durat initi script realli well viewer side major discus evid seem clear cut doubt seem gener nonspecif thi good way start mean viewer also question taken along journey like men juri gradual get detail doubt tweak point solv crime done way interest engag it perfect regard though jump big assumpt stretch knowledg room littl conveni howev weak materi cover fact deliveri roundli quit brilliant lumet direct within room make great use small space it feel like could play sure lumet prevent feel like film theatr the camera captur room stick close charact move around accordingli never feel stiff thi aid sen tension audienc point view left watch room much the ensembl cast anoth big factor deliveri deliv on surfac charact could easili label racist old naïv angri actor dont let basic also good job pace build resent tension room convinc fonda mayb topbil least showi role lead corner cobb begley good turn anger room everyon play part well ok balsam webber voskovec come least memor lot understand view besid sterl turn fielder klugman warden sweeney marshal there realli isnt weak link room with modern cynic eye perhap total hard accept film prais juri system i agre mym group made refer moment hlot essenti bitter revers film howev slightli flagwav stuff cover deliveri strong well pace overal emin watchabl film i understand well regard the materi messag may noteperfect deliveri brilliant across board one i could easili return still get pleasur well done,Positive

"... the main flaw being that everybody brings their own life experiences and history into the jury room with them, no matter how hard they try to be impartial.

Here you have a trial of a young boy who supposedly stabbed his father to death. When the jurors go back to deliberate on the case, ALL but one lone man played with a quiet courage by Henry Fonda states guilty and the rest of the film is about trying to get them to his side. Quite an amazing movie if you ask me. Fonda's case is not that the boy is innocent, but that the threshold of reasonable doubt has not been reached. The trick in this film is that it never leaves the jury room. You have no idea of what the defendant, the prosecuting attorney, or the defense attorney were like other than retroactively through the words of the jurors.

Writing this good just can't be ignored. Reginald Rose's screenplay is absolutely brilliant. Not only are the characters of twelve individuals indelibly implanted in your brain within the limited time span of about 100 minutes, but Rose accomplishes this feat without undue speechifying or pontificating about injustice or the failures of the jury system or expositional dialogue. The characters personalities come out in the course of the film and are not ""set up"" in the first half hour, (as in having the jurors explain to each other what their occupations and backgrounds are) as is the case with mediocre screenplays. As for the acting it is true ensemble greatness. All twelve cast members are excellent, although if you put a gun to my head and forced me to say who was best I'd express a partiality for Lee J Cobb as the toughest nut to crack for acquittal and E. G. Marshall as a juror who is all logic and no emotion other than arrogance. And Sidney Lumet's first film just may be his most fast paced. The hundred minutes whiz by! Not a dull stretch to be seen anywhere.

And yes, these are twelve white men judging a Puerto Rican boy, and yes Henry Fonda violated many classic rules of jury behavior when he introduced items into the discussion that were not official evidence, but this was 60 years ago and it IS a movie. So just suspend your beliefs and try to enjoy the art of the thing -the riveting dialogue, the character studies that don't choke each other out, and the brilliant camera-work that manages to make the room seem increasingly smaller so that you can appreciate the claustrophobia that must be setting in with the jurors as deliberations wear on and get more heated.",main flaw everybodi bring life experi histori juri room matter hard tri imparti here trial young boy supposedli stab father death when juror go back deliber case all one lone man play quiet courag henri fonda state guilti rest film tri get side quit amaz movi ask fonda case boy innoc threshold reason doubt reach the trick film never leav juri room you idea defend prosecut attorney defens attorney like retroact word juror write good cant ignor reginald rose screenplay absolut brilliant not charact twelv individu indel implant brain within limit time span minut rose accomplish feat without undu speechifi pontif injustic failur juri system exposit dialogu the charact person come cours film set first half hour juror explain occup background case mediocr screenplay a act true ensembl great all twelv cast member excel although put gun head forc say best id express partial lee j cobb toughest nut crack acquitt e g marshal juror logic emot arrog and sidney lumet first film may fast pace the hundr minut whiz not dull stretch seen anywher and ye twelv white men judg puerto rican boy ye henri fonda violat mani classic rule juri behavior introduc item discus offici evid year ago is movi so suspend belief tri enjoy art thing rivet dialogu charact studi dont choke brilliant camerawork manag make room seem increasingli smaller appreci claustrophobia must set juror deliber wear get heat,Positive

"So simple yet so brilliant, 12 ANGRY MEN is not to be missed. It's the tale of the meticulous Mr. Davis, a juror not quite convinced of a murder suspect's guilt despite what appears to be overwhelming evidence. His questions gradually persuade his fellow jurors that things aren't always as open-and-shut as they might seem.

One of the great all-time ensemble casts highlights 12 ANGRY MEN. Henry Fonda is superb as the hardcore skeptic... but then again, everyone is superb, from Joseph Sweeney as the eldest juror to E.G. Marshall as the no-nonsense Juror #4. Anytime a film set almost exclusively at a single cramped table in a single cramped room can spellbound the viewer, you know you've got first-rate actors. The clever, colorful dialog is a treat as well.

Yet the strongest asset of 12 ANGRY MEN is the demands it makes of the viewer to think critically. Initially we are like most of the jurors, curious as to how Fonda can be so naive to think the young suspect may be innocent. But he gradually pulls us into his line of reasoning, challenging our assumptions and finding fault with the supposed facts. By the film's end, we're left wondering how we could have been so narrow-minded just 90 minutes earlier.

As sharp as what's on screen is, 12 ANGRY MEN is equally smart for what it does not show. Many of today's filmgoers would demand flashback sequences to depict what the characters describe. They would want to get to know the accused killer so they could judge him for themselves. They would want more action, more pizazz, and changes of scenery. Yet it's precisely the film's refusal to do any of this that makes it work so well. The viewer is effectively the 13th juror with nothing but recollections of testimony to go on. Our imaginations are free to create a picture of the alleged murder, just as we would have to as part of the jury.

12 ANGRY MEN is often cited as one of the greatest films ever. It's a verdict that is well deserved.",so simpl yet brilliant angri men miss it tale meticul mr davi juror quit convinc murder suspect guilt despit appear overwhelm evid hi question gradual persuad fellow juror thing arent alway openandshut might seem one great alltim ensembl cast highlight angri men henri fonda superb hardcor skeptic everyon superb joseph sweeney eldest juror eg marshal nononsens juror anytim film set almost exclus singl cramp tabl singl cramp room spellbound viewer know youv got firstrat actor the clever color dialog treat well yet strongest asset angri men demand make viewer think critic initi like juror curiou fonda naiv think young suspect may innoc but gradual pull u line reason challeng assumpt find fault suppos fact by film end left wonder could narrowmind minut earlier a sharp what screen angri men equal smart show mani today filmgoer would demand flashback sequenc depict charact describ they would want get know accus killer could judg they would want action pizazz chang sceneri yet precis film refus make work well the viewer effect th juror noth recollect testimoni go our imagin free creat pictur alleg murder would part juri angri men often cite one greatest film ever it verdict well deserv,Positive
"And that what I did, I friend of mine has been annoying me about seeing this film and since the film is not a long one (about 90 minutes) I said why not, and then after just 30 minutes I decided to put this film on the very top of my all time favorite film list.

The fact that the film has been shot in one room blew my mind away, seems very easy to direct huh? But with a superb script and acting Sidney Lumet created one of the greatest films ever made if not the greatest.

The dialogue is realistic and so sharp with a brilliant acting from Henry Fonda and Lee J.Cobb, I feel this film is still underrated even in IMDb rankings.

And that line ""well, so long"" stayed with me ever since I saw the film as on of the greatest lines ever.

"Twelve jurors deliberate the case of an 18-year-old impoverished youth accused of stabbing his father to death. While 11 Jurors are immediately in favor of a ""guilty"" verdict with Juror #3 (Lee J. Cobb) the loudest supporter, one juror, Juror #8 (Henry Fonda), stands as the lone ""Not Guilty"" verdict and feels they should discuss the case rather than immediately render a verdict. As deliberations commence in the sweltering jury room during a heat wave positions and assumptions are challenged as jurors find their pre-conceived notions and personal prejudices challenged by new lights shone on the facts, witnesses and evidence.

12 Angry Men is an adaptation of the 1954 television play Twelve Angry Men written by Reginald Rose for anthology series Studio One. The success of the teleplay resulted in stage adaptations, which in turn lead to a theatrical adaptation in 1957 produced by Henry Fonda. The movie also became the directorial debut of Sidney Lumet who had done TV work for both Studio One and The Alcoa Hour. While the movie received critical acclaim including Academy Award nominations for Best Picture, Best Director, and Best Adapted Screenplay, the movie was a box office disappointment in the US (but did better internationally) due to the advent of color and widescreen productions and it wouldn't be until television airings the film would find an audience. 12 Angry Men has ingrained itself in pop culture with all manner of references, allusions, and parodies of the work still being made to this day as well as re-adaptations both domestically and abroad. Rightly so, because while 12 Angry Men's premise is very simple, it's filled with all manner of complex characters we get to know over the course of its 90 minute runtime.

The movie is essentially a chamber piece. Aside from scenes at the opening and closing of the movie, once we're in that jury room with our collection of actors featuring E. G. Marshall, Martin Baslam, and John Fiedler just to name a few we don't leave and the actors all give weight and presence to their characters so we feel like we get to know their personalities and histories and they play well off each other as tensions escalate. The movie takes a detached view of the murder case with most of the elements conveyed to us from second hand recounts of eyewitness statements leaving the audience very much in the position of determining whether or not the accused is in fact guilty with the same unreliable evidence.

12 Angry Men remains a solid chamber drama with great performances from its ensemble and timeless themes. Henry Fonda gives a great performance, but it wouldn't stand out as much without the great assortment of other actors he plays off of. It's a classic for a reason.",twelv juror deliber case yearold impoverish youth accus stab father death while juror immedi favor guilti verdict juror lee j cobb loudest support one juror juror henri fonda stand lone not guilti verdict feel discus case rather immedi render verdict a deliber commenc swelter juri room heat wave posit assumpt challeng juror find preconceiv notion person prejudic challeng new light shone fact wit evid angri men adapt televis play twelv angri men written reginald rose antholog seri studio one the success teleplay result stage adapt turn lead theatric adapt produc henri fonda the movi also becam directori debut sidney lumet done tv work studio one the alcoa hour while movi receiv critic acclaim includ academi award nomin best pictur best director best adapt screenplay movi box offic disappoint u better intern due advent color widescreen product wouldnt televis air film would find audienc angri men ingrain pop cultur manner refer allus parodi work still made day well readapt domest abroad rightli angri men premis simpl fill manner complex charact get know cours minut runtim the movi essenti chamber piec asid scene open close movi juri room collect actor featur e g marshal martin baslam john fiedler name dont leav actor give weight presenc charact feel like get know person histori play well tension escal the movi take detach view murder case element convey u second hand recount eyewit statement leav audienc much posit determin whether accus fact guilti unreli evid angri men remain solid chamber drama great perform ensembl timeless theme henri fonda give great perform wouldnt stand much without great assort actor play it classic reason,Positive

The characters we're supposed to like all make calm, reasonable arguments.

"When I found this movie in the ""Top 250"" in such a high position, i was quite surprised, especially when I realized that 90% of the movie happens in a room, and that's a risk, Because you need the characters to be quite flashy and that the script that is delivered has to be very entertaining not to be bored, and it goes that this movie does not bore you, it keeps you intrigued by the case that is, the juries are very Outstanding, I will not do a long review, it is only a recommendation of a person who doubted much of a movie of this style and was fascinated.

(It is also an important fact to say that I am not a man very interested in crime issues, nor very knowledgeable about it.)

The film deals with the case of a young man who is being blamed for murder and the jury must decide whether to give the maximum penalty or not. It is a plot that looks pretty simple, noting that this movie is based on a play from what I understand. What I called a lot of the movie is the atmosphere that you are given in the room, a hot day, 12 tired men and some of them want to leave as quickly as caring the sentence really. This film I liked also because it deals with quite interesting subjects: doubt, as our experience affects us in our decisions, go, subjects that look in perspective rather boring (Thinking of someone who only wants to watch a movie and not a moral debate) but that Are developed so well and subtly that you do not feel that you are giving a speech, you feel that you are watching a movie with interesting themes.

"Twelve Angry Men was a very good movie, with good dialogue and an excellent cast. The cast had a lot of opposite personalities which made the dynamics on the movie very interesting to watch. Although the audio was not as good as present day films and the dialogue was occasionally slow, the tension and interplay of the jurors quickly picked up again and kept your interest in the movie. It was amazing how one by one Henry Ford's character was able to convert all the other jurors over to a non-guilty verdict. It was really scary how all of the other 11 jurors wanted to vote guilty just to get the trial over with because they didn't want to be stuck at the courthouse. They all had better things to do, like go to a baseball game or visit with the friends and they didn't want to look to closely at the accuracy of the testimony, but Henry Ford's character made them take the time to think it through. Watching the movie Twelve Angry Men was much better than reading the written play because you could really see all the characters more clearly. The emotions, the tension and the frustration was so much more obvious in the film and came across so much more strongly than it did in written form.

"A lot has already been said about this masterpiece, thus it seems almost unnecessary to praise its many qualities. There two elements in particular, though, which set it apart from other classics.

One is how it showcases the sheer power of good screenplay and acting. There's no need for special effects, stunning cinematography or forced plot twists to create an intelligent and extremely entertaining film. Director Sidney Lumet only needed one room, twelve good actors and a timeless issue. With twelve distinctive characters, there are endless possibilities for interaction between them: what would happen if an extremely rigorous man had to cooperate with someone who'd rather play tic-tac-toe? Or an old man who finds himself ignored by many with a young businessman who costantly talks about his job?

The second aspect is how, despite being more than sixty years old, this movie's characters are incredibly relatable. Everyone has their biases, some are more emotional, some calmer, some more rigorous, some more chaotic. It is safe to say that we all now at least someone who resembles each of the twelve angry men. What is extraordinary is that this incredibly poignant characterisation is achieved with little more than an hour and a half for twelve distinct jurors, and all of them are memorable.

If you want to experience the power of cinema, regardless of your age, gender and cultural upbringing, watch this - you won't regret it.",a lot alreadi said masterpiec thu seem almost unnecessari prais mani qualiti there two element particular though set apart classic one showcas sheer power good screenplay act there need special effect stun cinematographi forc plot twist creat intellig extrem entertain film director sidney lumet need one room twelv good actor timeless issu with twelv distinct charact endless possibl interact would happen extrem rigor man cooper someon whod rather play tictacto or old man find ignor mani young businessman costantli talk job the second aspect despit sixti year old movi charact incred relat everyon bias emot calmer rigor chaotic it safe say least someon resembl twelv angri men what extraordinari incred poignant characteris achiev littl hour half twelv distinct juror memor if want experi power cinema regardless age gender cultur upbring watch wont regret,Positive

"The unsurpassed character studies of the ""12 Angry Men"" would almost make a movie worth seeing even if it had little else to offer. This is also a very good drama that uses everything it has to good advantage. The cast and director Sidney Lumet all do a fine job of sketching each character efficiently and memorably. Every character is important, and almost every line serves a purpose.

One interesting thing about the story is that the trial per se is almost not even particularly important. The jury setting is really just a stylized way of high-lighting many aspects of human nature and human interaction, and in particular, the varied ways that different persons respond in situations where their options are limited. The characters have a wide and well-chosen diversity of personalities and opinions, and each one's temperament and attitudes are developed as things proceed.

In performing this kind of material, it's important for the actors not to overdo it, or else the believability suffers. It's also a challenge to keep things interesting when the settings and props are so limited. But everything works very well here, and it is a credit to everyone involved.",the unsurpass charact studi angri men would almost make movi worth see even littl el offer thi also good drama use everyth good advantag the cast director sidney lumet fine job sketch charact effici memor everi charact import almost everi line serv purpos one interest thing stori trial per se almost even particularli import the juri set realli styliz way highlight mani aspect human natur human interact particular vari way differ person respond situat option limit the charact wide wellchosen diver person opinion one tempera attitud develop thing proceed in perform kind materi import actor overdo el believ suffer it also challeng keep thing interest set prop limit but everyth work well credit everyon involv,Positive
"I personally think the movie Twelve Angry Men is better then the play. Not just for the reasons that I like retro movies or that the acting was so bad it was kind-of funny. But for the fact that the movies plot connected to me in a way I don't think it connected with other people. Because I have a thing for law and I think that this plot and this movie/play showed me a different side of law that isn't really talked about, but is a big part of the process. The reason I picked the movie over the play was that I guess my era is used and is attracted to movies more then to reading also that it was funny that the whole movie was 90 minutes of twelve men sitting in one room which got really boring but not as boring as the play. This might not be the best. Another reason I don't like the play as much as the movie is that. I don't think everyone was interested as I was and didn't really follow along and when it came to their part to read I was ready and they weren't ready to read which was really boring. Because yo9u would have to wait for them and I think I fell asleep a couple times. But overall the movie was WAY better then the play. If you're into law I think it's a must see.

"12 Angry Men (1957) is a movie I recently watched for the first time in a long time on Tubi. The storyline follows a jury trying a case for murder where everyone agrees but one person. That one person discusses the case with the jury and explains why he doesn't agree based on the evidence. Will the jurors change their mind and align with the man or will it be a hung jury?

This movie is directed by Sidney Lumet (Before the Devil Know You're Dead) and stars Henry Fonda (The Wrong Man), Lee J. Cobb (On the Waterfront), Jack Warden (Heaven Can Wait), Edward Binns (Patton), Martin Balsam (Psycho) and E. G. Marshall (Creepshow).

The storyline for this picture is very smart and unique. The acting and dialogue is out of this world and the storyline is well paced and unfolds well. The acting is splendid and Fonda and Cobb's back and forth is very good. There are many unpredictable elements. Some of the sequences felt unrealistic; but overall, it was still an entertaining watch.

This movie isn't perfect but it is definitely worth a viewing. I would score this an 8/10 and strongly recommend it.",angri men movi i recent watch first time long time tubi the storylin follow juri tri case murder everyon agre one person that one person discus case juri explain doesnt agre base evid will juror chang mind align man hung juri thi movi direct sidney lumet befor devil know your dead star henri fonda the wrong man lee j cobb on waterfront jack warden heaven can wait edward binn patton martin balsam psycho e g marshal creepshow the storylin pictur smart uniqu the act dialogu world storylin well pace unfold well the act splendid fonda cobb back forth good there mani unpredict element some sequenc felt unrealist overal still entertain watch thi movi isnt perfect definit worth view i would score strongli recommend,Positive
"This film is superb, in fact as Shakespeare once said ""Its the bees' knees"". The film captivates the audience from the beginning. Each of the twelve jurors are introduced to us as they are introduced to themselves. The characters are well draw out and individual, each with his own personality.

The tension of the characters draws the audience in from the start. We imagine that the case is open and shut, 11 me saying guilty and 1 not. We feel the discomfort of Henry Fonda as the other characters belittle and mock how he can see any reasonable doubt in the case. But we also share his victories and the enthusiasm as he proceeds to refute or add doubt to the arguments for guilty and are captivated and draw in as other jurors begin to see doubt in the proceedings.

The audience can also see the arguments for guilty and wonder if Fonda's character is correct in saying that he doubts. Yet they also feel the shame of the characters as he disproves that a previously sound theory is iron tight, joining his side as members of the jury do.

On top of this they are wonderfully woven in human elements such as the misconceptions that influence people and the growing tension between different characters. This is brought to life even more by the amazing performances, Fonda, Lee J Cobb and Joseph Sweeney are of particular note.

I started watching this film on a bored relaxed laying about day but by the end i was on the edge of the seat with my hands on my knees feeling more tense than a politician on results day.

"12 Angry Men is a terrific film that reflects a lot of the past problems and the proposed solutions of immigration, youth violence, and of course, overcoming one's own background and discrimination. The film surprised me in how progressive it was, and the ending social conclusions that it reached.

In the film you can see clearly form a rift between the upper class, conservatives who are unwilling to change and the progressives who are proposing change for the better of all of us; this film, deep down, is a very class conscious and socially conscious film about discrimination and the deep lines it had in American society in 1957.

Although the film's portrayal is sometimes overly simplistic, drawing a ""stubborn, pig-headed"" conservative versus ""righteous, just"" progressive, one can find that this was very much so a necessary film for its' time. In many ways, it is a work that was socially far advanced.

Also what is interesting is the fact that it is a film that is done with great simplicity; some actors, and a room... It relies greatly upon the pure talent of the actors, and the great direction of Sidney Lumet -- this film is truly unique due to the true minimalism it embraces in its' production tactics, yet this is something that could easily go unnoticed due to the incredible quality of the film.",angri men terrif film reflect lot past problem propos solut immigr youth violenc cours overcom one background discrimin the film surpris progress end social conclus reach in film see clearli form rift upper class conserv unwil chang progress propos chang better u film deep class consciou social consciou film discrimin deep line american societi although film portray sometim overli simplist draw stubborn pighead conserv versu righteou progress one find much necessari film time in mani way work social far advanc also interest fact film done great simplic actor room it reli greatli upon pure talent actor great direct sidney lumet film truli uniqu due true minim embrac product tactic yet someth could easili go unnot due incred qualiti film,Positive
"Intense courtroom drama which has 12 very different people, all males, struggling with a murder case involving a young Puerto Rican boy that seems cut-and-dried. However, juror Henry Fonda does not believe it to be as sure-fire as it appears. He votes not guilty and what follows is a chain of events that will test the views, beliefs and thoughts of the other 11 members. Fonda is great, but Lee J. Cobb steals every scene (and that is not easy to do in a film like this). Ed Begley, Martin Balsam, Jack Warden, Jack Klugman, Joseph Sweeney, E.G. Marshall and John Fiedler are among the other individuals caught in a situation that is much more difficult than it appears on the surface.

The screenplay is sophisticated and smart, and the story is compelling and intelligent. The film is also brilliantly made, and the acting is superb.

"Gosh, I don't know how many times I studied this play and performed it in high school, not to mention how many television shows had an episode that was inspired by 12 Angry Men. It was always a great drama because of the raw human emotions that were so true and remain timeless, this play will never be dated. I couldn't wait to see this movie when I saw it at the video store and it was the first movie I slipped into the DVD player. First off, I was incredibly impressed with the credits, we not only had Henry Fonda, we had Lee J. Cobb in the cast! This movie was so well performed and such a treasure, god, I couldn't ever say any words to justify it. I've done this a million times, but here is another summary of what 12 Angry Men is all about.

12 jurors are about to make a decision about a murder case, over all it seems like an open and shut case with tons of evidence that would make any good man look guilty, an 18 year old boy is about to be put to death if convicted. 11 of the men vote guilty, only one vote holds them back and they have to discuss the trial once again due to one vote being not guilty. Jurour #8 refuses to just jump to conclusions and brings up incredible possibilities that can always make a man think of ""reasonable doubts"", one by one the jurors begin to see the points he is making, except for one stubborn #3 who would rather just pull the switch to the chair himself.

12 Angry Men is a timeless tale that could either be told very badly, i.e. 7th Heaven, or incredibly well and bring out terrific performances like Henry and Lee did. Actually, the whole cast was terrific, there wasn't a performance that was off key, movies like this are so needed in Hollywood today, it was so simple, but added so much for a 30 minute play. Please, if you have any taste, you will truly enjoy 12 Angry Men and have a great appreciation for it!

"This is one of those movies where everything could go wrong. The story is as simple as it can be: 12 men are jurors on a open and shut murder trial, but one man thinks that another persons life deserves at least some thought on the matter and votes not guilty. From this point on we have 12 actors and a closed room. This could be the most boring film ever made. Lumet however is a master of mise-en-scene and provides a tense movie that keeps you locked on from the word ""go"". The dialogs are great and supported by incredibly talented actors.

"I could go on, but I thought I'd stop there before my summary line gets too big. Now just because this is a classic movie (and we really should try to use that term lightly, but this movie really deserves it and I'll elaborate on that), does not mean everybody will love it. And if one does not like it, it does not mean they have no taste. They just have different tastes, which is a good thing, because if every human on earth would have the same taste, life would be very boring now wouldn't it? The asnwer is yes, in case you were wondering.

But back to this, which begins outside and takes us inside. And it is important that we were outside because we will live inside a building (a room to be more specific) for the most time. There is also a brief shot of the alleged culprit/criminal. After that we get in a room with 12 men, who are quite different from each other. And while it wasn't yet time to give African American a chance in a movie like that (or Asian American for that matter), there is a critical racial line that is drawn. If you follow what is happening and who says what or argues in certain ways, you will see that this movie has quite the social commentary in it.

Now that is one part of this being genius, because it never rubs your nose in it. It never says, this guy who is i.e. from Italian descent has a reasonable thing/argument to say. No you just hear the things and see the people interact. And I have not even mentioned the way the movie is shot. And I'm not talking about the black and white cinematography (which is beautifully lit), no. I mean the framing and the set-ups. the editing and how everything flows. You feel like you're inside the room. You feel like this really happens or happened. Even the things that seem not staged (someone blocking another person, a shadow, peoples back and more) are in fact staged and masterfully done so.

There are way smarter people than me, that can list you many things this movie has done right and I'm sure there quite a few sources online to look for. Just listening to the audio commentary can give a small glimpse into certain things too. But again, since this is not something that one might call light entertaining, if it does not appeal to you, then it is so.

"This film deserves to be on anyone's list of top films. My problem is that it is so perfect, so seamlessly polished, it is hard to appreciate the individual excellences.

The acting is top notch. I believe that monologue acting is quite a bit simpler than real reactive ensemble acting. Most of what we see today is monologues pretending to be conversations. But in this film, we have utter mastery of throwing emotions. Once the air becomes filled with human essence, it is hard to not get soaked ourselves as the camera moves through the thick atmosphere. Yes, there are slight differences in how each actor projects (Fonda internally, Balsam completely on his skin...) but the ensemble presents one vision to the audience.

The writing is snappy too. You can tell it was worked and worked and worried, going through several generations. It is easy to be mesmerized by this writing and acting, and miss the rare accomplishment of the camera-work. This camera is so fluid, you forget you are in one room. It moves from being a human observer, to being omniscient, to being a target. It is smart enough to seldom center on the element of most importance, so expands the field to all men.

This is very hard. Very hard, to make the camera human. So much easier to do what we see today -- acknowledge the machinery and jigger with it. Do we have a filmmaker today who could do this?

The case seems open and shut with a murder weapon and several witnesses to place the boy at the scene of the crime. For eleven of the jurors the decision is apparent that the boy is guilty but for one juror, Mr. Davis (Henry Fonda), the boy's life should entail some discussion to eliminate any reasonable doubt the jurors may have. As the film progresses the personalities of the jurors become apparent and many underlying issues influence the guilty decision chosen by the majority of the jurors.

The underlying issues are the complexity of the personalities of the jurors and the reasons why they have the motivation to feel and act the way they do. As the case unfolds further, more is learned about each juror individually. The personalities range from being a short-tempered loud mouth to a straight- laced accountant who never breaks a sweat. As the movie progresses much more is learned of the characters that exposes the intricacy of human nature and people's different personality traits.

This film is an excellent example of movie making that does not require elaborate sets to entertain the viewer. The majority of the film takes place in a jury room with the men never leaving the room from their deliberation responsibilities. The cast and dialogue make this film memorable and the film has some clear moral issues that are addressed. The main issue is that not everything is as it seems. With further analysis the understanding of a situation becomes more concrete enabling the men to make a solid decision that affects a young man's life. 12 Angry Men is a classic film that should not be missed.",the plot angri men revolv around murder trail latino boy accus kill father the convict boy would mean death sentenc destini boy life hand twelv male juror rang person the case seem open shut murder weapon sever wit place boy scene crime for eleven juror decis appar boy guilti one juror mr davi henri fonda boy life entail discus elimin reason doubt juror may a film progress person juror becom appar mani underli issu influenc guilti decis chosen major juror the underli issu complex person juror reason motiv feel act way a case unfold learn juror individu the person rang shorttemp loud mouth straight lace account never break sweat a movi progress much learn charact expo intricaci human natur peopl differ person trait thi film excel exampl movi make requir elabor set entertain viewer the major film take place juri room men never leav room deliber respons the cast dialogu make film memor film clear moral issu address the main issu everyth seem with analysi understand situat becom concret enabl men make solid decis affect young man life angri men classic film miss,Neutral

"This film is my submission as the greatest ensemble cast performance in the HISTORY of CINEMA! As it was released when I was only 9 years old.... I have viewed it on multiple occasions... But to be honest, I cannot remember exactly when I saw it for the first time!

I must admit that the intricacies of jury duty selection in the New York area in the 1950's is something of which I know absolutely nothing about.... But I have often wondered if women, for some reason, were exempt from jury duty in New York 65 years ago!?!?!?

Leaving that issue aside, let's focus on the film itself. Some of the actors in the cast, like Henry Fonda, Lee J. Cobb and Ed Begley, were already well known when it was released in 1957. For Most of the others, their participation in this Classic certainly augmented their stature greatly! Although 12 ANGRY MEN was Nominated for Best Picture, Best Director and Best Adapted Screenplay, This Number 6 Highest Rated Movie of ALL-TIME, sadly, struck out at the Oscars... Winning nary a single Golden Statuette! I invite any and all of You reading my Review to focus on each and every astounding characterization rendered in this movie. With each viewing, I have come to appreciate and savor every detail, of every performance, all the more!

As someone who has seen thousands of movies, 12 ANGRY MEN lets You totally get into the head of each and every character... As almost no other film, before or since! 12, layer by layer, methodically peels away the facade that is part and parcel of our subconcious self-protection and insulation from letting ourselves become too vulnerable and over-exposed to scrutiny by others!

If You have never seen 12 ANGRY MEN... for whatever reason... or reasonS... You must place it at the very TOP of Your WATCH LIST! If perhaps, You saw it once, twice...or even three time, many years ago... I beseech You to revisit it! I am absolutely certain that You will thank yourself handsomely for doing so!",thi film submiss greatest ensembl cast perform histori cinema a releas i year old i view multipl occas but honest i cannot rememb exactli i saw first time i must admit intricaci juri duti select new york area someth i know absolut noth but i often wonder woman reason exempt juri duti new york year ago leav issu asid let focu film some actor cast like henri fonda lee j cobb ed begley alreadi well known releas for most other particip classic certainli augment statur greatli although angri men nomin best pictur best director best adapt screenplay thi number highest rate movi alltim sadli struck oscar win nari singl golden statuett i invit you read review focu everi astound character render movi with view i come appreci savor everi detail everi perform a someon seen thousand movi angri men let you total get head everi charact a almost film sinc layer layer method peel away facad part parcel subconci selfprotect insul let becom vulner overexpos scrutini other if you never seen angri men whatev reason reason you must place top your watch list if perhap you saw twiceor even three time mani year ago i beseech you revisit i absolut certain you thank handsom,Positive
"Shot in real time, this story of a jury trying to decide whether a young man is innocent or guilty never lets the viewer's attention go. Henry Fonda plays Juror #8, who is convinced the entire time that the defendant is innocent, while everyone else has already called him guilty. Throughout the movie, we not only get to hear everyone's opinions on the matter, but also every possibility of the verdict. With ""12 Angry Men"", Sidney Lumet brought to the screen the same kind of ""closing in"" feeling that he brought to movies like ""Network"". In the end, the issue is not whether the defendant is innocent or guilty; the important point is the process by which the jurors reached their decision. This may be THE perfect movie.",shot real time stori juri tri decid whether young man innoc guilti never let viewer attent go henri fonda play juror convinc entir time defend innoc everyon el alreadi call guilti throughout movi get hear everyon opinion matter also everi possibl verdict with angri men sidney lumet brought screen kind close feel brought movi like network in end issu whether defend innoc guilti import point process juror reach decis thi may the perfect movi,Positive

"12 Angry Men may be the greatest film of the 1950's. It really is unlike other films, as it's takes place in mostly 1 location, over an hour and a half, and there's no actions - just a conversation. The acting just feels so natural, almost like they improvised the entire film. All the characters are distinct, and very memorable, especially juror 8.

Ultimately, the film is all about influencing a group, and how everything at face value shouldn't be taken for fact. Juror number 8, despite talking the least, has the most influence over the group. Everything that seems a fact, the eyewitness seeing the kid through the passing El train, can be rexamined, and twisted. The film shows the jurors to be tribalistic, and how some of the jurors' mostly strongly held beliefs are also their least challenged. A fascinating film.",angri men may greatest film it realli unlik film take place mostli locat hour half there action convers the act feel natur almost like improvis entir film all charact distinct memor especi juror ultim film influenc group everyth face valu shouldnt taken fact juror number despit talk least influenc group everyth seem fact eyewit see kid pas el train rexamin twist the film show juror tribalist juror mostli strongli held belief also least challeng a fascin film,Neutral
"An excellent 10-star well-acted and well-written movie.

12 Angry Men began with the court, judge, jury and defendant awaiting deliberation.

The movie should have ended with the court, judge, jury and defendant hearing the final verdict. This would have made the movie perfect. It is the responses from all involved in the court room that complete a movie. Sudden quick endings leave a feeling of incompleteness.

"Eleven to one, there is one enter dissenter among the Jury in the trial of a young man who's accused of murdering his father.

This for me is one of the greatest films of all time, it somehow never suffers as the years go past. Twelve men from different backgrounds, with different view points come together, their mission, to determine the guilt of one young man, it's an amiable start, but soon tempers begin to fly as the status quo is questioned.

I love that we're in for the kill as it were, we see no crime, or anything associated, everything we get is given to us by The Jurors, it is an incredible way of telling the story, I can't think of any other film that took this unique approach,

It scrutinises the many weaknesses people have, prejudices, preconceived ideas, anger and personal grievance, but it's balanced out by showing the exact opposite, bravery, faith, intelligence, the ability to listen and question. This film ranks as one of the best studies of human nature in existence.

If you've done jury service you'll relate to it, you have people that want to question, and you have people that want to get out of there and on with their lives as quickly as possible.

It's incredible to think of a time when Juries consisted of twelve whits men, it would have taken a brave man to be a single disagreeing voice.

"""12 Angry Men"" A chamber film about self-discovery.

""They have twelve pieces of paper... Twelve chances to kill!"" - tagline and the only thing I knew about the film. And that's what I'd like to shoot!

I love when the essence of the film sounds in the ""background"". We watch the jury deliberate on whether the boy is guilty of murdering his father, and we see each character's soul unfold. Based on emotions, thinking about the case by the words of his life problems, almost every character builds a monument of his character and breaks it into pieces. Juror 9's monologue about an old man who, at 79 years old, just wants to be heard, gets me every time. And with all prof. Deformation, I forget that I'm watching a movie.

And if you watched the movie and are waiting for comments about the case itself, facts and evidence - I have nothing to say. Many people have already done it for me. I remembered only people who reveal the truth in themselves by spending an hour talking to strangers. And it is stronger than any multiverse.",angri men a chamber film selfdiscoveri they twelv piec paper twelv chanc kill taglin thing i knew film and that id like shoot i love essenc film sound background we watch juri deliber whether boy guilti murder father see charact soul unfold base emot think case word life problem almost everi charact build monument charact break piec juror monologu old man year old want heard get everi time and prof deform i forget im watch movi and watch movi wait comment case fact evid i noth say mani peopl alreadi done i rememb peopl reveal truth spend hour talk stranger and stronger multivers,Positive

"This movie is *not* a courtroom (or jury room) drama. It's about how a jury room can become a sanctuary that changes the lives of the jurors. It heavily implies that any place could become a place of metamorphosis if we only dug deeper with each other regarding each other's thoughts and beliefs.

What seems to be a closed case slowly unravels through deeper discussion. In the beginning, 11-1 is the vote in favor of guilty, a vote to send an 18 year old to the electric chair for murdering his father. One juror thinks there should be more discussion. He stands up to a lot of ridicule, but perseveres and slowly has his doubts vindicated as more jurors notice fishy things about the case and change their votes.",thi movi courtroom juri room drama it juri room becom sanctuari chang live juror it heavili impli place could becom place metamorphosi dug deeper regard other thought belief what seem close case slowli unravel deeper discus in begin vote favor guilti vote send year old electr chair murder father one juror think discus he stand lot ridicul persever slowli doubt vindic juror notic fishi thing case chang vote,Neutral
"This movie came out of an era that I really loved, when ensemble acting was so strong. We had a whole group of character actors who really took seriously the smaller roles that they had. The direction by Sidney Lumet on this film is outstanding. To take the Henry Fonda character from the meek, inconsequential juror, simply putting forth a theory, to watching the other men slowly see his way of thinking, is subtlety at its best. Lee J. Cobb does his burn, done in by impatience and inconvenience. Pusing an agenda that fits only him. Underlying the entire plot is the defendant whom we never see but get to know through a slow, methodical, yet fascinating series of revelations.

"A dissenting juror (Henry Fonda) in a murder trial slowly manages to convince the others (Jack Klugman , Martin Balsam , Jack Warden , Lee. J. Cobb , Ed Begley , E.G. Marshall , Robert Webber , among others) that the case is not as obviously clear as it seemed in court. As Juror #8 holds out with a verdict of not guilty, thus setting the stage for arguments and reasons why or why not the boy may be guilty . As he desperately seeks to convince his eleven peers to reconsider their hast conviction of a boy framed of murdering . As 12 jurors are struggling to decide the fate of a teenager who allegedly killed his father .

Made for television classic about twelve jurors quick to condemn a youth on trial for murdering his father before reviewing the evidence. Though the whole movie is set in a jury room it never lacks for taut , suspense , intrigue and inspired direction . The struggle behind closed doors is tense , charged and riveting . Reginald Rose's brilliant TV play script was left virtually intact in its move to feature film. This famous play from the 'Golden Age of Television' was splendidly directed by Sidney Lumet with an extraordinary plethora of actors who give magnificent performances .Because the painstaking rehearsals for the film lasted an exhausting two weeks, filming had to be completed in an unprecedented 21 days and shot in a total of 365 separate takes. However, nowadays none of the twelve stars are still alive . The acting level of the cast during some of the intense discussions and debates almost bursts in the screen . The movie is commonly used in business schools and workshops to illustrate team dynamics and conflict resolution techniques. Nominated for 3 Oscars , another 16 wins & 6 nominations ; the film lost out in all its categories to The Bridge on the River Kwai . It ranked #2 on the American Film Institute's list of the 10 greatest films in the genre ""Courtroom Drama"".

This Lumet's impressive debut was followed by a remake made for cable TV (1997) , a contemporized rendition of the memorable tale whose script has been slightly updated but the premise is the same , it was directed by William Friedkin with a formidable cast such as William L. Petersen, Edward James Olmos, Hume Cronyn, James Gandolfini, Dorian Harewood, Ossie Davis, and Courtney B. Vance , George C.

I just don't see this movie in the same league as some of the others at the top of best movie lists- Shawshank, Godfather, Schindler's list, even Pulp Fiction. It's not just because it is a classic black and white movie, I love that about it. It's a Wonderful Life blows this away.

"A young ethnic kid from a rough area is up on a murder charge and to the jury of twelve men, it all seems a fairly open and shut case. So all are surprised when the votes come back with one ""not guilty"" in the pack. Juror #8 maintains he holds a reasonable doubt, much to the frustration of the rest of the group. The stalemate forces a debate over the details of the case which sees each man questioning others and themselves for their motivations and decisions. The heat in the room and the passage of time sees tensions rising by the minute.

I'm not a massive fan of the ""Movie You Must See"" podcast crew because they mostly tend to discuss the events in a film rather than really critiquing or reviewing it (although at times this ""mates in a pub"" approach is OK). Anyway, one of the advantages of having anyone pointing out ""films you should see"" is that it reminds you that you should these films. So it was for me as I listened to 12 Angry Men and realised that not only had I never reviewed it but that I had not actually watched it for many years. Of course mentally I knew it was a ""classic"" but did I really understand why it was? So when it came on television recently I watched it again with new eyes.

The films moves right into the jury room and pretty much this room is all we have for the duration. Initially the script does really well to have the viewer side with the majority because in the discussions the evidence does seem very clear cut and #8's doubts seem so general and non-specific. This is a good way to start because it means the viewer also has to question and we are taken along the journey just like the men in the jury. Gradually we get into the detail and doubts are tweaked out  not to the point of solving the crime because that is not what it is about but it is done in a way that is interesting and engaging. It is not perfect in this regards though because some of the jumps are big, some of the assumptions are stretching and some of the knowledge in the room is a little too convenient. However what weaknesses there are in the material are covered by the fact that the delivery is roundly quite brilliant.

Lumet directions from within the room and makes great use of such a small space. It feels like it could be a play (not sure if it was or not) but Lumet prevents this just feeling like filmed theatre. The camera captures the room, sticks close to characters, moves around, in and out accordingly and it never feels stiff. This aids the sense of tension from the audience point of view as we are not just left watching the room so much as being in it. The ensemble cast are another big factor in this delivery as they all deliver. On the surface of it the characters could easily be labelled ""racist"", ""old"", ""naïve"", ""angry"" and so on but the actors don't let themselves be that basic and they also do a good job of pacing the building resentment and tension in the room to be convincing. Fonda maybe has ""top-billing"" but he does have the least showy role, leading those into his corner. Cobb and Begley have good turns as the anger of the room but everyone plays their parts very well. OK Balsam, Webber and Voskovec come out the least memorable of the lot but this is understandable when viewed beside such sterling turns from Fielder, Klugman, Warden, Sweeney and Marshall. There really isn't a weak link in the room.

With modern cynical eyes it is perhaps totally hard to accept the film for its praise of the jury system and I do agree with the ""MYMS"" group when they made reference to the moment in H:LOTS which is essentially the bitter reverse of this film. However this slightly flag-waving stuff is covered by the delivery being as strong and as well paced as it is. Overall then this is an eminently watchable film and I can understand why it is so well regarded. The material and message may not be note-perfect but the delivery is brilliant across the board and it is one that I could easily return to again and again and still get pleasure out of how well it is all done.",a young ethnic kid rough area murder charg juri twelv men seem fairli open shut case so surpris vote come back one guilti pack juror maintain hold reason doubt much frustrat rest group the stalem forc debat detail case see man question other motiv decis the heat room passag time see tension rise minut im massiv fan movi you must see podcast crew mostli tend discus event film rather realli critiqu review although time mate pub approach ok anyway one advantag anyon point film see remind film so i listen angri men realis i never review i actual watch mani year of cours mental i knew classic i realli understand so came televis recent i watch new eye the film move right juri room pretti much room durat initi script realli well viewer side major discus evid seem clear cut doubt seem gener nonspecif thi good way start mean viewer also question taken along journey like men juri gradual get detail doubt tweak point solv crime done way interest engag it perfect regard though jump big assumpt stretch knowledg room littl conveni howev weak materi cover fact deliveri roundli quit brilliant lumet direct within room make great use small space it feel like could play sure lumet prevent feel like film theatr the camera captur room stick close charact move around accordingli never feel stiff thi aid sen tension audienc point view left watch room much the ensembl cast anoth big factor deliveri deliv on surfac charact could easili label racist old naïv angri actor dont let basic also good job pace build resent tension room convinc fonda mayb topbil least showi role lead corner cobb begley good turn anger room everyon play part well ok balsam webber voskovec come least memor lot understand view besid sterl turn fielder klugman warden sweeney marshal there realli isnt weak link room with modern cynic eye perhap total hard accept film prais juri system i agre mym group made refer moment hlot essenti bitter revers film howev slightli flagwav stuff cover deliveri strong well pace overal emin watchabl film i understand well regard the materi messag may noteperfect deliveri brilliant across board one i could easili return still get pleasur well done,Positive

"... the main flaw being that everybody brings their own life experiences and history into the jury room with them, no matter how hard they try to be impartial.

Here you have a trial of a young boy who supposedly stabbed his father to death. When the jurors go back to deliberate on the case, ALL but one lone man played with a quiet courage by Henry Fonda states guilty and the rest of the film is about trying to get them to his side. Quite an amazing movie if you ask me. Fonda's case is not that the boy is innocent, but that the threshold of reasonable doubt has not been reached. The trick in this film is that it never leaves the jury room. You have no idea of what the defendant, the prosecuting attorney, or the defense attorney were like other than retroactively through the words of the jurors.

Writing this good just can't be ignored. Reginald Rose's screenplay is absolutely brilliant. Not only are the characters of twelve individuals indelibly implanted in your brain within the limited time span of about 100 minutes, but Rose accomplishes this feat without undue speechifying or pontificating about injustice or the failures of the jury system or expositional dialogue. The characters personalities come out in the course of the film and are not ""set up"" in the first half hour, (as in having the jurors explain to each other what their occupations and backgrounds are) as is the case with mediocre screenplays. As for the acting it is true ensemble greatness. All twelve cast members are excellent, although if you put a gun to my head and forced me to say who was best I'd express a partiality for Lee J Cobb as the toughest nut to crack for acquittal and E. G. Marshall as a juror who is all logic and no emotion other than arrogance. And Sidney Lumet's first film just may be his most fast paced. The hundred minutes whiz by! Not a dull stretch to be seen anywhere.

And yes, these are twelve white men judging a Puerto Rican boy, and yes Henry Fonda violated many classic rules of jury behavior when he introduced items into the discussion that were not official evidence, but this was 60 years ago and it IS a movie. So just suspend your beliefs and try to enjoy the art of the thing -the riveting dialogue, the character studies that don't choke each other out, and the brilliant camera-work that manages to make the room seem increasingly smaller so that you can appreciate the claustrophobia that must be setting in with the jurors as deliberations wear on and get more heated.",main flaw everybodi bring life experi histori juri room matter hard tri imparti here trial young boy supposedli stab father death when juror go back deliber case all one lone man play quiet courag henri fonda state guilti rest film tri get side quit amaz movi ask fonda case boy innoc threshold reason doubt reach the trick film never leav juri room you idea defend prosecut attorney defens attorney like retroact word juror write good cant ignor reginald rose screenplay absolut brilliant not charact twelv individu indel implant brain within limit time span minut rose accomplish feat without undu speechifi pontif injustic failur juri system exposit dialogu the charact person come cours film set first half hour juror explain occup background case mediocr screenplay a act true ensembl great all twelv cast member excel although put gun head forc say best id express partial lee j cobb toughest nut crack acquitt e g marshal juror logic emot arrog and sidney lumet first film may fast pace the hundr minut whiz not dull stretch seen anywher and ye twelv white men judg puerto rican boy ye henri fonda violat mani classic rule juri behavior introduc item discus offici evid year ago is movi so suspend belief tri enjoy art thing rivet dialogu charact studi dont choke brilliant camerawork manag make room seem increasingli smaller appreci claustrophobia must set juror deliber wear get heat,Positive

"So simple yet so brilliant, 12 ANGRY MEN is not to be missed. It's the tale of the meticulous Mr. Davis, a juror not quite convinced of a murder suspect's guilt despite what appears to be overwhelming evidence. His questions gradually persuade his fellow jurors that things aren't always as open-and-shut as they might seem.

One of the great all-time ensemble casts highlights 12 ANGRY MEN. Henry Fonda is superb as the hardcore skeptic... but then again, everyone is superb, from Joseph Sweeney as the eldest juror to E.G. Marshall as the no-nonsense Juror #4. Anytime a film set almost exclusively at a single cramped table in a single cramped room can spellbound the viewer, you know you've got first-rate actors. The clever, colorful dialog is a treat as well.

Yet the strongest asset of 12 ANGRY MEN is the demands it makes of the viewer to think critically. Initially we are like most of the jurors, curious as to how Fonda can be so naive to think the young suspect may be innocent. But he gradually pulls us into his line of reasoning, challenging our assumptions and finding fault with the supposed facts. By the film's end, we're left wondering how we could have been so narrow-minded just 90 minutes earlier.

As sharp as what's on screen is, 12 ANGRY MEN is equally smart for what it does not show. Many of today's filmgoers would demand flashback sequences to depict what the characters describe. They would want to get to know the accused killer so they could judge him for themselves. They would want more action, more pizazz, and changes of scenery. Yet it's precisely the film's refusal to do any of this that makes it work so well. The viewer is effectively the 13th juror with nothing but recollections of testimony to go on. Our imaginations are free to create a picture of the alleged murder, just as we would have to as part of the jury.

"And that what I did, I friend of mine has been annoying me about seeing this film and since the film is not a long one (about 90 minutes) I said why not, and then after just 30 minutes I decided to put this film on the very top of my all time favorite film list.

The fact that the film has been shot in one room blew my mind away, seems very easy to direct huh? But with a superb script and acting Sidney Lumet created one of the greatest films ever made if not the greatest.

The dialogue is realistic and so sharp with a brilliant acting from Henry Fonda and Lee J.Cobb, I feel this film is still underrated even in IMDb rankings.

And that line ""well, so long"" stayed with me ever since I saw the film as on of the greatest lines ever.

"Twelve jurors deliberate the case of an 18-year-old impoverished youth accused of stabbing his father to death. While 11 Jurors are immediately in favor of a ""guilty"" verdict with Juror #3 (Lee J. Cobb) the loudest supporter, one juror, Juror #8 (Henry Fonda), stands as the lone ""Not Guilty"" verdict and feels they should discuss the case rather than immediately render a verdict. As deliberations commence in the sweltering jury room during a heat wave positions and assumptions are challenged as jurors find their pre-conceived notions and personal prejudices challenged by new lights shone on the facts, witnesses and evidence.

12 Angry Men is an adaptation of the 1954 television play Twelve Angry Men written by Reginald Rose for anthology series Studio One. The success of the teleplay resulted in stage adaptations, which in turn lead to a theatrical adaptation in 1957 produced by Henry Fonda. The movie also became the directorial debut of Sidney Lumet who had done TV work for both Studio One and The Alcoa Hour. While the movie received critical acclaim including Academy Award nominations for Best Picture, Best Director, and Best Adapted Screenplay, the movie was a box office disappointment in the US (but did better internationally) due to the advent of color and widescreen productions and it wouldn't be until television airings the film would find an audience. 12 Angry Men has ingrained itself in pop culture with all manner of references, allusions, and parodies of the work still being made to this day as well as re-adaptations both domestically and abroad. Rightly so, because while 12 Angry Men's premise is very simple, it's filled with all manner of complex characters we get to know over the course of its 90 minute runtime.

The movie is essentially a chamber piece. Aside from scenes at the opening and closing of the movie, once we're in that jury room with our collection of actors featuring E. G. Marshall, Martin Baslam, and John Fiedler just to name a few we don't leave and the actors all give weight and presence to their characters so we feel like we get to know their personalities and histories and they play well off each other as tensions escalate. The movie takes a detached view of the murder case with most of the elements conveyed to us from second hand recounts of eyewitness statements leaving the audience very much in the position of determining whether or not the accused is in fact guilty with the same unreliable evidence.

12 Angry Men remains a solid chamber drama with great performances from its ensemble and timeless themes. Henry Fonda gives a great performance, but it wouldn't stand out as much without the great assortment of other actors he plays off of. It's a classic for a reason.",twelv juror deliber case yearold impoverish youth accus stab father death while juror immedi favor guilti verdict juror lee j cobb loudest support one juror juror henri fonda stand lone not guilti verdict feel discus case rather immedi render verdict a deliber commenc swelter juri room heat wave posit assumpt challeng juror find preconceiv notion person prejudic challeng new light shone fact wit evid angri men adapt televis play twelv angri men written reginald rose antholog seri studio one the success teleplay result stage adapt turn lead theatric adapt produc henri fonda the movi also becam directori debut sidney lumet done tv work studio one the alcoa hour while movi receiv critic acclaim includ academi award nomin best pictur best director best adapt screenplay movi box offic disappoint u better intern due advent color widescreen product wouldnt televis air film would find audienc angri men ingrain pop cultur manner refer allus parodi work still made day well readapt domest abroad rightli angri men premis simpl fill manner complex charact get know cours minut runtim the movi essenti chamber piec asid scene open close movi juri room collect actor featur e g marshal martin baslam john fiedler name dont leav actor give weight presenc charact feel like get know person histori play well tension escal the movi take detach view murder case element convey u second hand recount eyewit statement leav audienc much posit determin whether accus fact guilti unreli evid angri men remain solid chamber drama great perform ensembl timeless theme henri fonda give great perform wouldnt stand much without great assort actor play it classic reason,Positive

"I'm going to be contrary. The movie is about as preachy as you can get. The 12 jurors are all cartoonish stereotypes, locked into their predictable characters. The unlikeable characters, of course, all make vacuous, absurd arguments for there position, while yelling and gesticulating. The characters we're supposed to like all make calm, reasonable arguments.

The morality is laid out in stark black and white. No grey, no ambiguity, no difficult choices. Me, I like a movie with a dilemma, and some ""lesser of two evils"" choices. Each character should also be a mixture of good and bad and grey.

"When I found this movie in the ""Top 250"" in such a high position, i was quite surprised, especially when I realized that 90% of the movie happens in a room, and that's a risk, Because you need the characters to be quite flashy and that the script that is delivered has to be very entertaining not to be bored, and it goes that this movie does not bore you, it keeps you intrigued by the case that is, the juries are very Outstanding, I will not do a long review, it is only a recommendation of a person who doubted much of a movie of this style and was fascinated.

(It is also an important fact to say that I am not a man very interested in crime issues, nor very knowledgeable about it.)

The film deals with the case of a young man who is being blamed for murder and the jury must decide whether to give the maximum penalty or not. It is a plot that looks pretty simple, noting that this movie is based on a play from what I understand. What I called a lot of the movie is the atmosphere that you are given in the room, a hot day, 12 tired men and some of them want to leave as quickly as caring the sentence really. This film I liked also because it deals with quite interesting subjects: doubt, as our experience affects us in our decisions, go, subjects that look in perspective rather boring (Thinking of someone who only wants to watch a movie and not a moral debate) but that Are developed so well and subtly that you do not feel that you are giving a speech, you feel that you are watching a movie with interesting themes.

"Twelve Angry Men was a very good movie, with good dialogue and an excellent cast. The cast had a lot of opposite personalities which made the dynamics on the movie very interesting to watch. Although the audio was not as good as present day films and the dialogue was occasionally slow, the tension and interplay of the jurors quickly picked up again and kept your interest in the movie. It was amazing how one by one Henry Ford's character was able to convert all the other jurors over to a non-guilty verdict. It was really scary how all of the other 11 jurors wanted to vote guilty just to get the trial over with because they didn't want to be stuck at the courthouse. They all had better things to do, like go to a baseball game or visit with the friends and they didn't want to look to closely at the accuracy of the testimony, but Henry Ford's character made them take the time to think it through. Watching the movie Twelve Angry Men was much better than reading the written play because you could really see all the characters more clearly. The emotions, the tension and the frustration was so much more obvious in the film and came across so much more strongly than it did in written form.

"A lot has already been said about this masterpiece, thus it seems almost unnecessary to praise its many qualities. There two elements in particular, though, which set it apart from other classics.

One is how it showcases the sheer power of good screenplay and acting. There's no need for special effects, stunning cinematography or forced plot twists to create an intelligent and extremely entertaining film. Director Sidney Lumet only needed one room, twelve good actors and a timeless issue. With twelve distinctive characters, there are endless possibilities for interaction between them: what would happen if an extremely rigorous man had to cooperate with someone who'd rather play tic-tac-toe? Or an old man who finds himself ignored by many with a young businessman who costantly talks about his job?

The second aspect is how, despite being more than sixty years old, this movie's characters are incredibly relatable. Everyone has their biases, some are more emotional, some calmer, some more rigorous, some more chaotic. It is safe to say that we all now at least someone who resembles each of the twelve angry men. What is extraordinary is that this incredibly poignant characterisation is achieved with little more than an hour and a half for twelve distinct jurors, and all of them are memorable.

"The unsurpassed character studies of the ""12 Angry Men"" would almost make a movie worth seeing even if it had little else to offer. This is also a very good drama that uses everything it has to good advantage. The cast and director Sidney Lumet all do a fine job of sketching each character efficiently and memorably. Every character is important, and almost every line serves a purpose.

One interesting thing about the story is that the trial per se is almost not even particularly important. The jury setting is really just a stylized way of high-lighting many aspects of human nature and human interaction, and in particular, the varied ways that different persons respond in situations where their options are limited. The characters have a wide and well-chosen diversity of personalities and opinions, and each one's temperament and attitudes are developed as things proceed.

In performing this kind of material, it's important for the actors not to overdo it, or else the believability suffers. It's also a challenge to keep things interesting when the settings and props are so limited. But everything works very well here, and it is a credit to everyone involved.",the unsurpass charact studi angri men would almost make movi worth see even littl el offer thi also good drama use everyth good advantag the cast director sidney lumet fine job sketch charact effici memor everi charact import almost everi line serv purpos one interest thing stori trial per se almost even particularli import the juri set realli styliz way highlight mani aspect human natur human interact particular vari way differ person respond situat option limit the charact wide wellchosen diver person opinion one tempera attitud develop thing proceed in perform kind materi import actor overdo el believ suffer it also challeng keep thing interest set prop limit but everyth work well credit everyon involv,Positive
"I personally think the movie Twelve Angry Men is better then the play. Not just for the reasons that I like retro movies or that the acting was so bad it was kind-of funny. But for the fact that the movies plot connected to me in a way I don't think it connected with other people. Because I have a thing for law and I think that this plot and this movie/play showed me a different side of law that isn't really talked about, but is a big part of the process. The reason I picked the movie over the play was that I guess my era is used and is attracted to movies more then to reading also that it was funny that the whole movie was 90 minutes of twelve men sitting in one room which got really boring but not as boring as the play. This might not be the best. Another reason I don't like the play as much as the movie is that. I don't think everyone was interested as I was and didn't really follow along and when it came to their part to read I was ready and they weren't ready to read which was really boring. Because yo9u would have to wait for them and I think I fell asleep a couple times. But overall the movie was WAY better then the play. If you're into law I think it's a must see.

"12 Angry Men (1957) is a movie I recently watched for the first time in a long time on Tubi. The storyline follows a jury trying a case for murder where everyone agrees but one person. That one person discusses the case with the jury and explains why he doesn't agree based on the evidence. Will the jurors change their mind and align with the man or will it be a hung jury?

This movie is directed by Sidney Lumet (Before the Devil Know You're Dead) and stars Henry Fonda (The Wrong Man), Lee J. Cobb (On the Waterfront), Jack Warden (Heaven Can Wait), Edward Binns (Patton), Martin Balsam (Psycho) and E. G. Marshall (Creepshow).

The storyline for this picture is very smart and unique. The acting and dialogue is out of this world and the storyline is well paced and unfolds well. The acting is splendid and Fonda and Cobb's back and forth is very good. There are many unpredictable elements. Some of the sequences felt unrealistic; but overall, it was still an entertaining watch.

This movie isn't perfect but it is definitely worth a viewing.

"At risk of repeating myself a few words in, let's not bury the lede: '12 angry men' is one of the greatest movies that will ever be made.

This film's reputation far precedes it, and it's taken me far too long to actually get around to watching it. It has far exceeded all possible expectations. The premise is so simple, and the plot is no more than a tracing of the jury's discussion, but those bare-bones elements are all that is necessary to produce a stunning, moving picture. Quintessential, paramount themes include and are not limited to prejudice and confirmation bias; redirected anger, ego, and inflated notions of masculinity; careful deliberation and critical thinking; reason, mob rule, and the former prevailing over the latter; loud mouths, empty heads, and hot tempers; presumption of innocence, the dire importance of ""doubt,"" due process, democracy, justice - and still more. It's a picture that is at times infuriating, sad, inspiring, or thought-provoking, and lively and stimulating at all points, while nonetheless spending 97% of its length within a single room. For all the rightly acclaimed features that have ever been made, precious few immediately make so staggering and lasting an impact as this. '12 angry men' is truly perfect.

The dialogue and scene writing in Reginald Rose's screenplay is ""everything,"" as the youths say. Even within a singular space these manage to be rich, vibrant, and dynamic, carrying a dazzling array of ideas, moods, and flavors. Though of a completely different genre, only one other picture (Tilman Singer's 2018 indie horror flick 'Luz') readily comes to mind as having achieved anything like the same effect of communicating a cohesive, whole narrative without actively filming that which is being described. It's the screenwriting equivalent of an ice cream cone that simultaneously embodies one's every favorite flavor, even those that ordinarily conflict and weren't scooped. The progression of the jurors' heated conversation is a stroke of brilliance, twisting and shifting with fiery passion and steadfast willfulness that roundly impresses. Just as notable is that '12 angry men' declines additional amplifying embellishments (e.g. A reveal that a juror is on the take) as we would expect of most courtroom dramas: this is the story of twelve men honoring their ""civil responsibility,"" and nothing more. And that is most assuredly all it needs to be.

Rose's characters represent a noteworthy (if entirely white and male) diversity of backgrounds, values, beliefs, and preconceptions. One could only imagine the fireworks that may ensue from a 21st century remake that reflects genuine, realistic diversity, but still this 50s rendition is enough without it. There is depth and complexity to each of the jurors that is wonderfully gratifying as a viewer - and the cast is utterly extraordinary in breathing life into them all. With character comportment ranging from calm and collected, to brash and volatile, and everything in between, every actor on hand is given stupendous opportunity to illustrate their skill, and they definitely do. Each individual performance is just magnificent as anything else in '12 angry men,' and marked with exquisite range, nuance, strength and force of personality, and physicality that turns one sweltering room into a blast furnace of deeply absorbing drama. I could name the actors one by one, but it's just as easy to scroll through the cast list - from one to the next, they are tremendous.

It would be very easy to speak at greater length about the resounding triumph of cinema '12 angry men' is, but there would come a point where one only talking in circles. Suffice to say that it's near-universal acclaim and high regard is absolutely deserved; I feel like a fool for having taken so long to ever watch it, and for the mere thought that it wouldn't hold up. Sixty-five years later this remains a masterful drama that demands to be seen wherever you may have the opportunity.",at risk repeat word let buri lede angri men one greatest movi ever made thi film reput far preced taken far long actual get around watch it far exceed possibl expect the premis simpl plot trace juri discus barebon element necessari produc stun move pictur quintessenti paramount theme includ limit prejudic confirm bia redirect anger ego inflat notion masculin care deliber critic think reason mob rule former prevail latter loud mouth empti head hot temper presumpt innoc dire import doubt due process democraci justic still it pictur time infuri sad inspir thoughtprovok live stimul point nonetheless spend length within singl room for rightli acclaim featur ever made preciou immedi make stagger last impact angri men truli perfect the dialogu scene write reginald rose screenplay everyth youth say even within singular space manag rich vibrant dynam carri dazzl array idea mood flavor though complet differ genr one pictur tilman singer indi horror flick luz readili come mind achiev anyth like effect commun cohes whole narr without activ film describ it screenwrit equival ice cream cone simultan embodi one everi favorit flavor even ordinarili conflict werent scoop the progress juror heat convers stroke brillianc twist shift fieri passion steadfast will roundli impress just notabl angri men declin addit amplifi embellish eg a reveal juror take would expect courtroom drama stori twelv men honor civil respons noth and assuredli need rose charact repres noteworthi entir white male diver background valu belief preconcept one could imagin firework may ensu st centuri remak reflect genuin realist diver still rendit enough without there depth complex juror wonder gratifi viewer cast utterli extraordinari breath life with charact comport rang calm collect brash volatil everyth everi actor hand given stupend opportun illustr skill definit each individu perform magnific anyth el angri men mark exquisit rang nuanc strength forc person physic turn one swelter room blast furnac deepli absorb drama i could name actor one one easi scroll cast list one next tremend it would easi speak greater length resound triumph cinema angri men would come point one talk circl suffic say nearunivers acclaim high regard absolut deserv i feel like fool taken long ever watch mere thought wouldnt hold sixtyf year later remain master drama demand seen wherev may opportun,Positive
"I have only seen this movie once, but it forever lives in my mind. I would very much like to own it on DVD soon.

The movie is over 60 years old but it still holds up today because of the tight-knit set and simple story. Some of the performances are still unsurpassed in regards to most of the classic cinema I have seen.

It is highly awarded/honored amongst the film society, and I recommend it to everyone because it is a classic and it has some of the most profound scenes you'll see from a movie even with little to no extreme action, gimmicks, etc.

Just great acting, a simple but profound story, excellent directing, good suspense, and more...

"12 Angry Men is a 1957 American drama film with elements of film noir, adapted from a teleplay of the same name by Reginald Rose. Written and co-produced by Rose himself and directed by Sidney Lumet, this trial film tells the story of a jury made up of 12 men as they deliberate the guilt or acquittal of a defendant on the basis of reasonable doubt. In the United States, a verdict in most criminal trials by jury must be unanimous. The film is notable for its almost exclusive use of one set: with the exception of the film's opening, which begins outside on the steps of the courthouse followed by the judge's final instructions to the jury before retiring, two short scenes in an adjoining washroom, and a brief final scene on the courthouse steps, the entire film takes place in the jury room. The total time spent outside the jury room is three minutes out of the full 96 minutes of the film.

12 Angry Men explores many techniques of consensus-building, and the difficulties encountered in the process, among a group of men whose range of personalities adds intensity and conflict. No names are used in the film: the jury members are identified by number until two of them exchange names at the very end, the defendant is referred to as ""the boy"", and the witnesses as ""the old man"" and ""the lady across the street"".

In 2007, 12 Angry Men was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being ""culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant"" and is often seen as one of the greatest films ever made.",angri men american drama film element film noir adapt teleplay name reginald rose written coproduc rose direct sidney lumet trial film tell stori juri made men deliber guilt acquitt defend basi reason doubt in unit state verdict crimin trial juri must unanim the film notabl almost exclus use one set except film open begin outsid step courthous follow judg final instruct juri retir two short scene adjoin washroom brief final scene courthous step entir film take place juri room the total time spent outsid juri room three minut full minut film angri men explor mani techniqu consensusbuild difficulti encount process among group men whose rang person add intens conflict no name use film juri member identifi number two exchang name end defend refer boy wit old man ladi across street in angri men select preserv unit state nation film registri librari congress cultur histor aesthet signific often seen one greatest film ever made,Neutral

"The first time I discovered IMDB's top 250 list, I noticed that ""12 Angry Men"" was the 5th best movie ever. I had heard of the film but only the version starring Jack Lemmon from 1997. After some research, I realized this film has one of the strongest casts of any movie ever released. Its cast has much success outside of this film. Out of the 12 jurors, five nominations for Oscars, three won Oscars, seven received an Emmy nomination, and six received a Golden Globe nomination. Henry Fonda, who is the film's lead actor, is one of my favorites of all time. His film ""On Golden Pond"" is a film that I view as perfection. Fond's performance in this film is one of the finest of his career.

This film also is directed by Sidney Lumet, who made another favorite movie of mine ""Murder on the Orient Express."" This film is one of those films that is pretty much perfect. I don't love it as much as ""Murder on the Orient Express,"" but I love it more than any other courtroom drama. It's better than my other two favorite courtroom dramas, ""My Cousin Vinny"" and ""The People vs. Larry Flynt."" I think it's much better than the highly overrated ""To Kil a Mockingbird."" I don't see what people see in that film. I think it's a six.

In Conclusion. This film is not the best Henry Fonda film (On Golden Pond). This film is not the best Sidney Lumet film (Murder on the Orient Express). It's not even the best Martin Balsam (Juror #1) film (Psycho). But it's one of my favorite films, Easily a 10/10.",the first time i discov imdb top list i notic angri men th best movi ever i heard film version star jack lemmon after research i realiz film one strongest cast movi ever releas it cast much success outsid film out juror five nomin oscar three oscar seven receiv emmi nomin six receiv golden globe nomin henri fonda film lead actor one favorit time hi film on golden pond film i view perfect fond perform film one finest career thi film also direct sidney lumet made anoth favorit movi mine murder orient express thi film one film pretti much perfect i dont love much murder orient express i love courtroom drama it better two favorit courtroom drama my cousin vinni the peopl v larri flynt i think much better highli overr to kil mockingbird i dont see peopl see film i think six in conclus thi film best henri fonda film on golden pond thi film best sidney lumet film murder orient express it even best martin balsam juror film psycho but one favorit film easili,Positive
"I hope that people don't see the score without reading the reviews as much as I think they do. Believe me, I find that you can still enjoy a movie, even respect it, without liking it. This is definitely the case with 12 Angry men. While I can enjoy the experience of watching the film, I've come to the rather unpopular opinion that this is not a great film. 12 Angry men works far better as a stage play, than a movie. As a film, it's quit uninspired and lacking emotion. The dialogue being as uninteresting as your least favorite math class, this is only accentuated by the fact that this film attempts to carry itself on dialogue and performance. Another problem comes right from the name itself; 12. The 12 angry men in the film are mostly indiscernible from each other, excluding a select few. While on stage the characters can show a lot of complexity with each actor playing off of each others emotions and bringing something new to performances each night, the film is lacking in character development.",i hope peopl dont see score without read review much i think believ i find still enjoy movi even respect without like thi definit case angri men while i enjoy experi watch film ive come rather unpopular opinion great film angri men work far better stage play movi a film quit uninspir lack emot the dialogu uninterest least favorit math class accentu fact film attempt carri dialogu perform anoth problem come right name the angri men film mostli indiscern exclud select while stage charact show lot complex actor play other emot bring someth new perform night film lack charact develop,Positive
"There's not much that can be said about 12 Angry Men apart from it being a very well made movie. It is ture that its plot is nothing special and it seems very boring at first but as you get deeper and deeper you start to enjoy it. Because the thing that makes this movie good is not some awesome and unique plot but the impressive dialogues. I actually think that this movie is a bit overrated but I have to admit that it has one of the best dialogues. These marvelous dialogues are the thing that makes this movie the masterpiece it is.

The acting is on an average level. The actors did a good job but I can't say that anyone of them did an outstanding performance. As for the cinematography it could've been better. I personally think that if they had shot this movie form different angles it would've looked more intriguing and intense.

"Juror #1, the foreman (Martin Balsam, football coach): ""Well, I won't be too technical, or make a long speech  it's just that it's a one-set film, so it's new and risky, because you know, dialogs are not enough, we need uh  the thrills  and it goes slowly in the beginning but progressively, it's like the jury room becomes smaller, and the faces bigger. I really felt the tense and suffocating atmosphere ... And what an explosive climax, I could hardly breathe  I know it's strange, but the direction, well, the movie is one hell of a thriller  I, well, my verdict is clear: GREAT MOVIE""

Juror #2 (John Fiedler, bank clerk): ""I don't know. It's an excellent film, served by great performances. Every character was convincing, so were their interactions. I can't find any flaw, for me, there's nothing to add, and nothing to remove. It is a GREAT MOVIE""

Juror #3 (Lee J. Cobb, businessman): ""I told you why this movie is great, it's just  thought provoking, everything and I mean everything looked like it would have been this kind of preachy film with a good-hearted hero and simple-minded antagonists who just want to be vindictive. But this is an intelligent film which, even at the end, makes you question if the kid is guilty or not. Because it has nothing to do with punishment, it's about justice ... without any prejudice, and that deserves respect, yes sir! No doubt for me  GREAT MOVIE""

Juror #4 (E.G. Marshall, stockbroker): ""First of all, it's an excellent examination of all the subtle nuances that enrich a male adult demography, played with such believability every one could identify with one of the jurors. Secondly, the writing was intellectually gripping and emotionally engaging and I would add: respectful of the viewer's intelligence. The direction was excellent and created a feeling of growing claustrophobia guided by a very clever use of focal lenses, a credit to Sidney Lumet. Last but not least, it's about the noble concept of justice and presumption of innocence: ""12 Angry Men"" delivers a brilliant, intelligent, and universally inspiring message. To conclude, I can say I had the privilege to watch a GREAT MOVIE""

Juror #5 (Jack Klugman, the man from the slum): ""What else to say? I second the idea that it's a powerful drama demonstrating how prejudices poison the heart of our civilization, and I believe this is one of the few films that should be screened everywhere in the world as a powerful lesson for tolerance. My verdict is: GREAT MOVIE""

Juror #6 (Edward Binns, painter): ""A movie that younger and future generations should watch and respect. These are movies with no special effects, no big-star cast, no big explosions, no flashy cars and no sexy girls. You have a honest, simple movie featuring ordinary men, but the result is so impacting it should be appreciated by any movie lover, regardless of his or her age. Anyway, GREAT MOVIE""

Juror #7 (Jack Warden, salesman): ""Come on, everyone is using big words and noble concepts, but for me, this movie is just damn entertaining. Hey admit it, the dialogs, the way opposite characters interact, create a lot of anxiety but is also very fun to watch, sometimes, well  I think you can say anything, but without entertainment, a film is worthless, and the movie could've been a bore, just all talk and no walk, but it wasn't, it worked for me ... GREAT MOVIE""

Juror #8 (Henry Fonda, architect): ""This movie invites us to explore our convictions and question the way they influence our judgments. Justice is done by men, blindly and implacably, this is why punishment must be beyond any doubt, and when you have what appears to be an open-and-shut case that progressively reveals some flaws as we go deeper in the subject, well, this says a lot about the negative impact of subjectivity when it comes to justice, and how we should be careful about the consequences of our thoughts, our words, our acts. ""12 Angry Men"" is a humanistic inspiration for those who have faith in justice. GREAT MOVIE""

Juror #9 (Joseph Sweeney, retired): ""This is a fantastic character study illustrating how convincingness is often driven by the personality. It's an incredible illustration of the way a few people can monopolize the talk and how a silent majority is eager to follow the ones who aggressively express their thoughts, and the courage it takes to be the lone dissenter and how using a constructive, polite and logical answer can destroy something taken for granted. While watching ""12 Angry Men"" I understood that a consensus, when rapidly built, means that the truth must be elsewhere. And one truth for sure, this is a GREAT MOVIE""

Juror #10 (Ed Begley, garage owner): ""I hate the patronizing way some left-wing good-hearted people adore this film, this has nothing to do with politics, truth or justice, it's about manipulation of your thoughts by pushing the right emotional button  you missed the point, and that's the beauty of the film, you're all easily fooled. Not for the reasons you think, but it's a GREAT MOVIE""

Juror #11 (Joseph Voskovek, watchmaker): ""No need to be American to appreciate the beauty of this film, it's about our deepest convictions. It's about the humanistic concept of reasonable doubt which can save even a guilty soul ... because life is valuable and justice is not vengeance. GREAT MOVIE""

Juror #12 (Robert Webber, advertising executive): ""Wow, what I can say, it's not an exact science you know  you can find a reason A to appreciate it, a reason B or C  let's just say that the 'sigma' of these reasons, explains why it's an incredible film and as my fellow jurors said, why ""12 Angry Men"" is a GREAT MOVIE""",juror foreman martin balsam footbal coach well i wont technic make long speech oneset film new riski know dialog enough need uh thrill goe slowli begin progress like juri room becom smaller face bigger i realli felt ten suffoc atmospher and explos climax i could hardli breath i know strang direct well movi one hell thriller i well verdict clear great movi juror john fiedler bank clerk i dont know it excel film serv great perform everi charact convinc interact i cant find flaw there noth add noth remov it great movi juror lee j cobb businessman i told movi great thought provok everyth i mean everyth look like would kind preachi film goodheart hero simplemind antagonist want vindict but intellig film even end make question kid guilti becaus noth punish justic without prejudic deserv respect ye sir no doubt great movi juror eg marshal stockbrok first excel examin subtl nuanc enrich male adult demographi play believ everi one could identifi one juror secondli write intellectu grip emot engag i would add respect viewer intellig the direct excel creat feel grow claustrophobia guid clever use focal lens credit sidney lumet last least nobl concept justic presumpt innoc angri men deliv brilliant intellig univers inspir messag to conclud i say i privileg watch great movi juror jack klugman man slum what el say i second idea power drama demonstr prejudic poison heart civil i believ one film screen everywher world power lesson toler my verdict great movi juror edward binn painter a movi younger futur gener watch respect these movi special effect bigstar cast big explos flashi car sexi girl you honest simpl movi featur ordinari men result impact appreci movi lover regardless age anyway great movi juror jack warden salesman come everyon use big word nobl concept movi damn entertain hey admit dialog way opposit charact interact creat lot anxieti also fun watch sometim well i think say anyth without entertain film worthless movi couldv bore talk walk wasnt work great movi juror henri fonda architect thi movi invit u explor convict question way influenc judgment justic done men blindli implac punish must beyond doubt appear openandshut case progress reveal flaw go deeper subject well say lot neg impact subject come justic care consequ thought word act angri men humanist inspir faith justic great movi juror joseph sweeney retir thi fantast charact studi illustr convincing often driven person it incred illustr way peopl monopol talk silent major eager follow one aggress express thought courag take lone dissent use construct polit logic answer destroy someth taken grant while watch angri men i understood consensu rapidli built mean truth must elsewher and one truth sure great movi juror ed begley garag owner i hate patron way leftw goodheart peopl ador film noth polit truth justic manipul thought push right emot button miss point that beauti film your easili fool not reason think great movi juror joseph voskovek watchmak no need american appreci beauti film deepest convict it humanist concept reason doubt save even guilti soul life valuabl justic vengeanc great movi juror robert webber advertis execut wow i say exact scienc know find reason a appreci reason b c let say sigma reason explain incred film fellow juror said angri men great movi,Positive
"A pure, simple, undeniable classic. This movie is a thoughtful, well shot, amazingly scripted, fantastically acted masterpiece. Even though the word masterpiece is often over-used (like genius) it certainly, and without dispute applies in this case. Sidney Lumet's directing is top-notch, and Henry Fonda is the still turning point of this small, microcosmic little world - his role has to be one of the most finely acted ever committed to film.

Set in an actual New York jury room, it's a claustrophobic, tightly confined set, where 12 very different men deliberate over the guilt of a young boy. Their prejudices, morals and personalities are thrown together and, sometimes violently, clash. Along with a great parallel commentary from the weather (at the beginning of the film, it's a stuffy, oppressive sweatbox, which becomes sidelined by a dark, stormy maelstrom outside the jury room) this is a fantastic film. You'd never think there were so many angles you could get from one single, uncomfortably confining room. Sidney Lumet's directing is amazing, as Fonda's chain-smkoing, softly spoken moralistic character could have been played so much darker; he manages to turn everyone around, slowly but surely, almost effortlessly converting even the most staunchly opposed and stoic juror - but he's not manipulative, sly or underhanded about it. He simply presents what is - he's the pure voice of reason, and he has some cracking lines. The other jurors are great, too. I'm sure we all know someone who fidgets through something important because they've got a football game starting in ten minutes - they all highlight broad generalisations of very human characters. I defy anyone not to find a character that illustrates someone they know in this motley crue.

"What a bloody stupid idea for a cinema film ! Adapt a teleplay set entirely in one studio bound location , written in real time with absolutely no cinema appeal whatsoever ! Me ? I wouldn`t have touched this script with a barge pole if I was a producer which just goes to show why - Only very very occasionally - some people deserve to be film producers while - Only very very occasionally - people like myself don`t . 12 ANGRY MEN is a masterpiece , maybe not in the way APOCALYPSE NOW or FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING are cinematic masterpieces , but it`s still a masterpiece of high drama

Despite being based on a play Lumet does bring some outstanding directorial flourishes to the film . Look at he scene where the camera cuts from one raised hand to another to an empty space that has a raised hand gingerly creeping into the frame , or the scene where the characters become more and more disgusted with Ed "" Know what I mean "" Begley`s reactionary diatribe . Please forgive Reginald Rose`s ever so slightly bleeding heart liberal subtext or a couple of unlikely occurances like the scene with the knife , or the fact that jury discussions are nothing like this in real life because even more thought went into this script as went into MEMENTO . This is a classic film and one of the few ones I`ve awarded 10 points to

"No sex, no graphic violence, no swearing, no nudity? Wow, what a concept. Great cast. Simple basic use your imagination and follow all the characters. Exceptional script. Dialog and body language were perfectly timed. You just don't find a super combination of talent, story line, directing, etc. any better then in this movie. I never get tired of watching this and find something new to focus on every time I watch this. This is real acting.

"You couldn't make make me sit through this one again!

Watching 12 stereotypes shaken together until the cream rises to the top is little better than watching water come to a boil. At first, the cold water is still and transparent, then tiny bubbles begin to form - yet the water is not even warm! It is the air coming out of solution! The bubbles grow larger and rise to the surface. Again, the water is clear, but movement can be detected. There are swirling convection currents forming. The water becomes hot. There is more and more movement, the surface of the water is clearly undulating, and the water is getting hotter. Bubbles again begin to form at the bottom of the pot. They expand and begin to rise, but collapse and disappear. The expansion and collapse of the water vapor creates noise and the pot begins to vibrate. Then traces of water vapor begin to rise from the rolling surface of the water. Finally, the bubbles of water vapor survive the journey to the surface and emerge - releasing steam to the air. How exciting!

Somehow, I just knew how everything would turn out - just like watching water boil, or shaking milk (I was around before homogenized milk).

I would recommend Andy Warhol's ""Empire"" to those who like this film. I won't give away the ending, but it's fairly predictable, and a bit longer than watching water boil.",you couldnt make make sit one watch stereotyp shaken togeth cream rise top littl better watch water come boil at first cold water still transpar tini bubbl begin form yet water even warm it air come solut the bubbl grow larger rise surfac again water clear movement detect there swirl convect current form the water becom hot there movement surfac water clearli undul water get hotter bubbl begin form bottom pot they expand begin rise collaps disappear the expans collaps water vapor creat nois pot begin vibrat then trace water vapor begin rise roll surfac water final bubbl water vapor surviv journey surfac emerg releas steam air how excit somehow i knew everyth would turn like watch water boil shake milk i around homogen milk i would recommend andi warhol empir like film i wont give away end fairli predict bit longer watch water boil,Neutral
"I saw this film for the first time a few months ago and i was automatically annoyed with myself for having not done so long before. To put short, this film is one of the best ever made and rightfully deserves its position on IMDBs top 250 list.

To be honest, there's not a lot that one can comment about the film. There are no special effects, dramatic monologues or defining scenes to discuss and really that's what makes this film the phenomenon that it is. It is quite easy to see where the film is going to go and how it is going to end early on but none of that really matters because excuse the sugary metaphor but it is the journey you embark on with the jurors, in particular Henry Fonda, that defines the film. The way in which each different aspect of the court case is re-evaluated is film heaven but also a hard hitter when reflecting on the seriousness that the film makes about judicial systems and the responsibility of juries to make thorough rational decisions.

If you had told me before the film that it was as near as makes no difference one scene with 12 men conversing for 100 minutes (or whatever), i would have kindly asked you if we could watch Die Hard instead, but oh what an ignorant error that would have been. 12 Angry Men is magnificent.",i saw film first time month ago automat annoy done long to put short film one best ever made right deserv posit imdb top list to honest there lot one comment film there special effect dramat monologu defin scene discus realli that make film phenomenon it quit easi see film go go go end earli none realli matter excus sugari metaphor journey embark juror particular henri fonda defin film the way differ aspect court case reevalu film heaven also hard hitter reflect serious film make judici system respons juri make thorough ration decis if told film near make differ one scene men convers minut whatev would kindli ask could watch die hard instead oh ignor error would angri men magnific,Positive
"In the days before cgi, massive hype, star-appeal, pseudo-mythic trilogies and all the other bumpf that hollywood tacks on to its product in order to make it sell, all it took to make a decent movie was to have a good script and cast, good direction and of course great acting.

These were (and still are) the only real ingredients which I'd say are essential for making a truly worthwhile movie.

"It's tough sometimes to translate a stage production- which 12 Angry Men essentially is- into a feature film, with in this case one cramped room and a dozen characters with totally varied ideals. In a way this is like the textbook example, however, of how to do a film like this. You see how the situation unfolds into something more, about the act of telling a story and finding all the pieces. That it has such a powerhouse of an ensemble doesn't hurt it at all, and the little surprises in how the casts acts and reacts works great on repeat viewings. The basic premise only needs brief mention, as the 12 men (totally angry may be disputed by some, though I'm sure not one is left without raising their voice), all white, are judging the case of a Hispanic charged with killing his father. The deliberation room becomes a kind of boiler room where Henry Fonda's juror #11, the only un-sure one, sets the stage for a something more to be revealed- human nature when on a judgment day, with all its intelligence, ignorance, hate, and seeking objectivism.

Sidney Lumet, on his very first feature-film, does a really professional (in a good way) job of directing the picture, by which a) letting the actors, who among the great lot include Lee J Cobb, John Fiedler, E.G. Marhall, Martin Balsam, Jack Klugman, Ed Begley, and in maybe the most under-rated role of the 'old man', Joseph Sweeney, just do their work and try to just make sure no one over-steps their ability in their strengths; b) using the atmosphere to high effect. Like he would later do with Network, Lumet uses the camera to add some level of subjectivity to the storytelling, being careful with choosing close-ups but using them very wisely (i.e. a surprise close-up on Sweeney), and here and there making it feel like the walls are just closing in a little more. But, at the same time, Lumet's making a studio picture, with the all-around good-guy Henry Fonda (in one of his best roles), and dealing with a story that's, when it comes down to it, just the details of a crime examined over. But the real strength of the film comes in a quality that it shares with Rashomon (different in structure to be sure), that the idea of looking for the truth is just a guise in a way to examine the people who are looking at what the truth is.

"12 Angry Men is as simple as it is profound, and as bare-boned as it is a showcase of true camera-work and directional complexity. It is as much a film about the justice system in America as it is a film about people; a film that lets the viewer into a single room for 90 minutes (the film moves forward quicker than real time) and examines the quirks, insecurities, prejudices and glaring background differences of twelve different characters.

The film begins in a courtroom as a murder case is coming to a close. The judge informs the twelve jurors of their duty as though it were just another day in his life, as though the defendant (an 18-year old street kid) has already been proved guilty. In general, nobody in the film expects the potential (and probable) difficulties that the viewer anticipates externally. It is an ""open and shut case"" as the remarkable, unnamed juror (played by Lee J. Cobb) states in the first ten minutes.

Of course it isn't, otherwise 12 Angry Men would be an ""open-and-shut"" film. Opening credits play over an empty room which gradually fills up as the jurors takes their seats and prepare for the ballot. Over this time, we see windows being opened, negotiations taking place and pleasantries exchanged. If these 12 men agree that the c12 Angry Men (1957) by Sidney Lumet - Unsung Filmsase presents enough evidence to show that the crime had in fact been committed, then the verdict will be guilty. But if there is any room for what the judge calls ""reasonable doubt"", then the verdict changes.

Each character in this film is entirely different. It almost feels as though each has been handpicked to take part in a sort of experiment – and it very much feels like we are watching one unfold. Each man represents something unalike. With one man's decision not to conform, or at least not to believe everything that was discussed in the courtroom, 12 Angry Men erupts. Gradually, we start to understand these men; first, we are let it on some of their social backgrounds – one is an immigrant (possibly Greek or French) and one admits to have grown up in the same conditions as the young defendant. Both men should be able to relate to the defendant in many ways – for a moment, we are afforded a glimpse at the defendant's face, an immigrant from an anonymous ghetto. Strangely, both men vote ""guilty"" without hesitation.

12 Angry Men (1957) by Sidney Lumet - Unsung FilmsHenry Fonda lets us in on his reason for disputing — he simply does not want to decide on a person's life in the space of five minutes. This is understandable; the viewer takes his side and so, it seems, does the filmmaker. But some of the jurors argue as though it were personal; as though the young man had slaughtered their own sons, daughters and wives. Some of the men, and most noticeably Cobb as juror no. 3, work themselves up into a blind fury.

As the film goes on, it becomes evident that the case was never as clear as the jurors had announced at the beginning. For some, the more reasonable and likable characters, it had simply been a case of accepting the evidence provided without questions. For others, assumptions had been made as a result of deep-rooted prejudices and massive complexes. While many change their minds with the influence of rational thought, some characters simply get angrier and more aggressive; two characters give away their racist views and the powerful scene that runs over the final ten minutes, works to reveal so much about the most moving and brilliant character portrayal in the film.

The happenings described in court unfold for a second time over the duration of 12 Angry Men. By the end, it as though we possess the same knowledge of what happened in the courtroom over the days of the trial, as the twelve men in the film. Helmed by Fonda, juror no. 8, the situation is played out again with incredible detail; every argument and theory presented to us is done so with such extreme care and passion. This is one of the film's that stay with you for a lifetime because its simplicity allows itself to be engraved in the mind, while the complexity of it demands that you make sure it is.",angri men simpl profound barebon showcas true camerawork direct complex it much film justic system america film peopl film let viewer singl room minut film move forward quicker real time examin quirk insecur prejudic glare background differ twelv differ charact the film begin courtroom murder case come close the judg inform twelv juror duti though anoth day life though defend year old street kid alreadi prove guilti in gener nobodi film expect potenti probabl difficulti viewer anticip extern it open shut case remark unnam juror play lee j cobb state first ten minut of cours isnt otherwis angri men would openandshut film open credit play empti room gradual fill juror take seat prepar ballot over time see window open negoti take place pleasantri exchang if men agre c angri men sidney lumet unsung filmsas present enough evid show crime fact commit verdict guilti but room judg call reason doubt verdict chang each charact film entir differ it almost feel though handpick take part sort experi much feel like watch one unfold each man repres someth unalik with one man decis conform least believ everyth discus courtroom angri men erupt gradual start understand men first let social background one immigr possibl greek french one admit grown condit young defend both men abl relat defend mani way moment afford glimps defend face immigr anonym ghetto strang men vote guilti without hesit angri men sidney lumet unsung filmshenri fonda let u reason disput simpli want decid person life space five minut thi understand viewer take side seem filmmak but juror argu though person though young man slaughter son daughter wive some men notic cobb juror work blind furi a film goe becom evid case never clear juror announc begin for reason likabl charact simpli case accept evid provid without question for other assumpt made result deeproot prejudic massiv complex while mani chang mind influenc ration thought charact simpli get angrier aggress two charact give away racist view power scene run final ten minut work reveal much move brilliant charact portray film the happen describ court unfold second time durat angri men by end though possess knowledg happen courtroom day trial twelv men film helm fonda juror situat play incred detail everi argument theori present u done extrem care passion thi one film stay lifetim simplic allow engrav mind complex demand make sure,Neutral
"An outstanding reenactment of writer Reginald Rose's superlative 1954 ""Studio One"" drama. Director Sidney Lumet shows how the boundaries in cinematic art can be stretched both ways; necessarily minimalist, he moves the actors and cameras in the jury room like a finely tuned ballet. Dependable Henry Fonda gives his best, and it's one of the most convincing ""Best Actor"" performances ever committed to celluloid. The supporting cast is perfect.

No matter how you feel about the film's thought-provoking thesis, you are captivated by juror Fonda's determination. When he introduces a switchblade into evidence - during deliberations! - like the pounding of a gavel, you know Fonda's intentions are premeditated; and, watching him unravel each juror's mind - along with your own - is truly stunning. Anyone interested in becoming a lawyer should consider Fonda a study model.

The defense rests.

"+++++ POSSIBLE SPOILERS +++++

""Twelve Angry Men"" is the perfect demonstration that when you have a good script, an intelligent director an a well selected cast a film doesn't have to be expensive or spectacular to be a real good one. This film is all about dialogues and acting and is set 95% in a small room yet its most entertaining and has a lot of tension.

When I said it had a well selected cast I didn't mean an all star cast; Henry Fonda was the only major star; Lee Cobb, Ed Begley, Martin Balsam and E.G. Marshall where very talented supporting actors but not stars; Jack Warden and Jack Klugman weren't even known much in films yet. But a simple direction by Sidney Lumet leaving the development to the script and actors performances worked well and the film is tense, intriguing and most entertaining from beginning to end.

""Twelve Angry Men"" is a ""trail film"" but with a very original focusing since by following the jury's debate the whole case is clearly revealed up to the verdict. It's also interesting that the verdict is not based in a not guilty conviction by the jurors but for the benefit of the doubt, which means that perhaps the boy actually killed his father.

One of the best movies I've ever seen in its genre.",possibl spoiler twelv angri men perfect demonstr good script intellig director well select cast film doesnt expens spectacular real good one thi film dialogu act set small room yet entertain lot tension when i said well select cast i didnt mean star cast henri fonda major star lee cobb ed begley martin balsam eg marshal talent support actor star jack warden jack klugman werent even known much film yet but simpl direct sidney lumet leav develop script actor perform work well film ten intrigu entertain begin end twelv angri men trail film origin focus sinc follow juri debat whole case clearli reveal verdict it also interest verdict base guilti convict juror benefit doubt mean perhap boy actual kill father one best movi ive ever seen genr,Positive

My main problem with the movie is that it is soooo preachy. The scene is painted in black and white, there are few shades of gray. Most of the character are stereotypes-- ie, the bigot, the bully, the nerd, the immigrant, the glad-handing but uncaring salesman, etc. It is a tribute to the fine actors that they bring such one-dimensional characters to life. And shining through it all is the oh so good man who has right, justice, and the American way on his side.

"Saw this first time when I was in 5th grade. Thot it was jus chatting n no action. Saw it again in 9th grade n found it to be totally engaging n character driven movie. Saw again in 2005 n then again few days back on a DVD. 12 Angry Men is a film that has aged incredibly well, offers fantastic performances, fantastic dialogues and a film that can be watched over and appreciated more and more each time. This movie shows in a marvelous simple way the mechanism of the justice system, how easily a man can be convicted to the death sentence based on prejudice, subjective declarations of witnesses and an unprofessional defense lawyer. Everything is good about this film. The screenplay by Reginald Rose (The wild geese, Escape from sobibor) is top notch. The direction by Lumet (Dog day aftnoon, Network, The verdict ) is excellent. It must be appallingly difficult to shoot an entire movie in such a small space, but Lumet does it superbly and the camera work is awesome. All the actors really got into the skin of the character n they portrayed their moods n emotions very well. Henry Fonda (The grapes of wrath, Once upon a time in the west, The longest day) n Lee J. Cobb (The exorcist, On the waterfront, Mackenna's gold) were awesome. So were the rest of the cast.

"A dissenting juror (Henry Fonda) in a murder trial slowly manages to convince the others that the case is not as obviously clear as it seemed in court.

Today's audiences will find a young Jack Warden, perhaps now best known as Big Ben from ""Problem Child"", and Wisconsin-born John Fiedler, whose voice is recognizable as Piglet from ""Winnie the Pooh"". Along with Ed Begley and Henry Fonda, you already have a strong cast (and the other eight men are no slouches).

This film is timeless, both as a tribute to great actors of their generation, but also as a testament of the greatness of the American justice system. One likes to think this has inspired at least a few people to approach jury duty with the utmost seriousness and give the concept of ""reasonable doubt"" a run for its money.",a dissent juror henri fonda murder trial slowli manag convinc other case obvious clear seem court today audienc find young jack warden perhap best known big ben problem child wisconsinborn john fiedler whose voic recogniz piglet winni pooh along ed begley henri fonda alreadi strong cast eight men slouch thi film timeless tribut great actor gener also testament great american justic system one like think inspir least peopl approach juri duti utmost serious give concept reason doubt run money,Positive
"I defy anyone to watch this movie and not be completely absorbed in the group dynamics on display. I could take points off for the overly tidy and convenient script with its TV-movie ending or some of the less subtle methods through which director Sidney Lumet drives home his points. But with a cast as uniformly excellent as this, why quibble? Henry Fonda is just the person to play the liberal everyman, an extension of his Tom Joad character from ""The Grapes of Wrath."" E.G. Marshall is excellent as Fonda's most formidable opponent; cool-headed and logical, he's the only holdout who bases his verdict on facts instead of emotions. Lee J. Cobb's performance wears thin, and his character is the most poorly written. Ed Begley is almost too good in his role, so revolting is his character. Jack Klugman and Jack Warden register in smaller roles as well.

This movie conveys the sweaty, tension-filled atmosphere of a stifling jury room but never feels oppressive, thanks to Lumet's fluid direction. My favorite moment comes when Fonda begins counting off paces around the jury table (a key piece of evidence hinges on this), and the camera drops to floor level and follows his feet as he does so. Choices like this prevent Lumet's film from ever being static or stagy.

An important film and a great one. If you haven't already seen it, put it at the top of your list.

"Overall I loved this movie. It shows the group-dynamics of 12 people, the jury, trying to decide if there is ""reasonable doubt"" concerning whether a young boy killed his father. The discussions are tense and little by little we learn from these what supposedly happened on that night the kids father died. We are therefore also drawn into the question of whether the boy did it or not ourselves and what at first seems like a clear cut case along the way becomes all of a sudden much more complicated. It is a film that dares to handle nuances and ambiguities (we are never certain of whether the boy did it or not) in a way we rarely see. Its also a movie that lets us watch these 12 angry men discuss in the same room for a full 96 minutes without it ever getting boring, which I have to respect; you really have to thrust your material to let a whole movie consist of a discussion.

The movie also tries to show how personal issues can cloud the judgments of the jurors. I am thinking about one specific juror, and although the idea, of showing us how his own personal story interferes with sound judgment, is splendid, I frankly didn't like the way it unfolded in the movie. That's why I only give this movie 8/10.

If this movie in any way is supposed to represent how the legal system work I pray to god that I will never be put in a situation where a jury have to decide my guilt in any matter.

"One does not expect an ordinary black and white movie like ""Twelve Angry Men"" to set the foundation for great drama. Nevertheless, superior drama is what is delivered in this film. The setting is; a common courtroom in an eastern metropolitan city where twelve ordinary men have been selected to sit as a jury. The trial is over and the verbal testimony having been heard, the jury must now decide the fate of the young man on trial for his life. A common enough occurrence in America. But what is not common, is the mixed assortment of characters assembled for the jury. The real drama unfolds when a single juror (Henry Fonda) takes his task seriously and challenges each of his fellow members to think and then decide before they vote for the death penalty. When he does, the volatile reaction is nothing short of inspirational. One can only wish the same would happen to anyone facing a similar ordeal. The cast of characters is a vintage performance from all. Henry Fonda's performance is wonderful and courageous. He is joined by veterans actors, Martin Balsam, John Fiedler, Lee J. Cobb, E.G. Marshall, Jack Klugman, Ed Binns, Jack Warden, Joseph Sweeney, Ed Begley, George Voskovec and Robert Webber.

"I won't repeat the details of the plot as many comments above summarize the plot and even the 12 jurors in depth...

Briefly, Fonda's character challenges the rest of the 12 man jury to take time to reexamine the evidence before they send a very young man to the mandatory death sentence.

A fair challenge. Even tho the case (as one juror argues ) seem so ""open and shut"".

Here, the best thing about the film (to me) is the use of logic. Why? As the 12 men examine each bit of proof, they discover several possible logical flaws or false assumptions. Sound too dry? Not the way it is presented.

My criticism is that Fonda's character is just too perfect, too right and (for most of the movie) too free from perspiration, unlike the rest in that hot jury room.

Fonda early questions some jurors as to whether there's any possibility for error. If he said ""It's possible"" one more time, I was going to scream. (I remember various evil characters getting off on slim technicalities...! ) But fortunately, his questioning leads others to question evidence and to find REAL doubt that the testimony, etc. is valid.

Their use of logic to pick out the evidentiary flaws is fascinating.

"12 Angry Men is a pretentious amateur ""detective"" story who's manipulative intent was easy to spot a mile away. As soon as they showed Henry Fonda's character of the The Architect (Juror # 8) I knew he was going to be the only one emotional enough to vote not guilty and with the help of very poor writing convince everyone else to do the same. Sure enough I was right.

Juror # 8 starts off just believing the 19-year old suspect was abused by his father for ""years"" with absolutely no evidence other than his bleeding heart and not simply disciplined for all the crimes he committed which included mugging, auto theft, robbery and knife fighting because as we know no one ever lies except of course all the eye witnesses in this trial and the detectives.

The Architect just makes one nonsense argument after another and every valid point brought up by the skeptics is just brushed aside until they finally change their mind for no logical reasoning whatsoever.

For instance, juror # 8 just manufacturers a time frame with no evidence to support it about how long it takes elevated train cars to pass by a single point. He does this based on his alleged past experience of living in an apartment near an elevated train line and everyone just buys it with no argument. This is embarrassingly bad for a number of reasons;

Since the film is set in New York City around 1956-57 we can find that during this time period there were 3 distinct elevated train car types (MUDC, Q-CARS and LO-V) from 7 different manufacturers (ACF, Cincinnati, IRT, Jewett, Pullman St. Louis, Wason) operating. It is just assumed in the film that every elevated train in NYC is made up of identical length, height and speed trains with the exact same window dimensions and placement when nothing could be farther from the truth.

What year did Juror # 8 have this apartment and what exact trains were running on the line at that time? Were those the same type's of train cars involved in this case? No answer is given. This is the equivalent of saying that you flew out of an airport years ago therefore all planes are the same and fly at the same speed with no control by the pilot.

Trains are operated by conductors and are variable speed, they speed up and slow down. At any given day a conductor could be running a train faster or slower for any number of reasons. They could be trying to make up time being late and running the train faster, they could have been tired and running the train slower to be safe or any number of other variables. There is no way to know the exact timing of the train that day unless you were there to time it.

Then the old man juror becomes an amateur criminal profiler and accuses the old man witness of lying to be important with no actual evidence to support this just his worthless opinion based on how he looks.

A juror not remembering the details of a movie is not an argument. The day a family member of mine died I have the movie I was watching seared into my head and will never forgot it. During times of increased stress like this you become hyper aware of everything.

The entire debate over how the suspect would have stabbed his dad is waste of time, all that matters was if it was plausible. How a juror would hold the knife is irrelevant.

Apparently the jurors have never heard of reading glasses or sunglasses which first became popular in the 1920's and The Stockbroker (Juror # 4) just decides to become an idiot on this point for no reason.

"Deceptively complex courtroom drama enthrals for the duration as one man opposes eleven others in a battle of argument, reason, and logic.

Starring Henry Fonda as Juror #8, 12 Angry Men is a very claustrophobic drama which conveys the deliberation room of a trial where the defendant is accused of first-degree murder. On the surface the case seems open and shut, with 11 of the 12 jurors entirely convinced by the prosecution's case. Only one dissenter remains, and that is Henry Fonda's Juror #8. Specifically he is not certain that the boy is definitely innocent, just that he doesn't know, and that for him is enough to qualify as reasonable doubt.

12 Angry Men certainly is a moralistic tale, of the right to a fair trial and trying to give someone every chance, but it has many more strings to its bow than just this. Indeed, above all else it prides itself in endeavouring to portray a true sense of reasoned and rational argument which tries to overcome steadfast beliefs as possessed by the seemingly unshakable. Initially it may seem that Fonda's Juror is simply playing devil's advocate, but it becomes clear that it is more about standing up for what you believe despite what the facts seem to tell you. The more you scrutinise so-called unshakable evidence, the more you find holes in it, and the more that logical analysis seems to provide the real answers.

Obviously, Juror #8 has to persuade those others who seem to have their own agenda, and pre-conceived notions of what truth equals, but nevertheless it is absolutely fascinating seeing how simply he probes the case and reveals the flaws.

The whole movie's pace is absolutely perfect, and given its almost exclusive setting of inside the deliberation room it is a testament to the genius of the script and the brilliance of the acting that the duration of the film seems so short. The cinematography is also surprisingly excellent given the lack of scope necessary, with sharp imagery and clever camera-work which gives the whole picture a real amount of life.

To detail the jurors themselves; Juror #1 reluctantly appoints himself foreman. He appears to lack esteem, and the chance to boss the table by being the 'leader' perversely appeals greatly to him as he lacks significant contribution to make about the case. He does not want to be useless, so is forced to take charge.

Juror #2 is a slight man who is clearly used to being wrapped in his own cocoon, never deviating, so when he ends up as a juror in a murder trial, he is actually thrilled at his fish out of water status. He does not really have much to say about the case, taking it at face value.

Juror #3 is the enduring Messenger Service owner. May have an ulterior motive for being so steadfastly sure the accused is guilty, given his first scene depicts ambivalence over the courtroom procedure given to him it is 'open and shut'. As time goes on, and evidence starts to suggest more than meets the eye, he begins to show emotional stress as his hardwired opinion looks flimsier. But he refuses to cave.

Juror #4 has more emotional attachment to the trial than most, as he shares the same kind of background to the defendant and takes criticism of 'that kind of person' extremely personally. Experiences inner conflict between head and heart.

Juror #5 is a cold and methodical thinker who has an elevated opinion of himself. Emerges more as the deliberations wear on, he is convinced by the evidence that the boy is guilty, and systematically sets about conveying this to the others.

Juror #6 is the common working man with very little input, and whose two significant moments are to defend another juror who is being harassed, and to suggest another juror is badly wrong about his opinion.

Juror #7 is more interested in the ball game at 8pm than the case. Doesn't want to be there, and while he details a little about the boy's background to start off with, his regular sarcastic quips throughout the story suggest he is simply desperate to be out of there as quickly as possible, with no care about the wheels of justice.

Juror #8 is the only juror who does not immediately join the others with their guilty verdict. He has a lot of thought about the case eating at him, and wishes to explore it. He meets much opposition.

Juror #9 is a wise, wiley old man who is sharper than anyone else and observed events in the courtroom closer than the others. Makes some smart observations which unearth vital truths.

Juror #10 is an old school racist whose opinion is based on prejudice and not facts. A vile and odious creature, he has no interest in 'people like that' roaming the streets, and is offended at having to live in the same city as them.

Juror #11 is an intelligent and interested spectator who listens to the facts and analyses them before reaching a conclusion. His European accent draws derision from some others, as does his general nationality, but he rises above it and provides some sensible comments, rarely saying anything which lacks thought.

Juror #12 is a good-natured man but not a terribly strong thinker. He does not have much of an independent opinion on the case, often following others, and is often more interested in playing naughts and crosses or boring fellow jurors about his job.

Overall, 12 Angry Men is simply as good as cinema can get. Incredible script, amazing performances, and captivating direction.

"Twelve-man jury decides the fate of a young man on trial for murder; eleven think the kid is guilty, the twelfth isn't so sure. Director Sidney Lumet makes his directorial debut here, and he's overly fond of riled-up actors shouting at the camera, but he doesn't stray from the proved path of this celebrated play by Reginald Rose, and that's a plus (the material stands quite well on its own). The claustrophobic, muggy atmosphere is rife with tension, and Henry Fonda is a tower of sanity as the only voice of reason. The film attempts to substitute the electricity of a live performance with too many tight shots of angry, sweaty faces, spitting and yelling, however this ensemble cast has a rich anti-camaraderie that puts the film across. *** from ****",twelveman juri decid fate young man trial murder eleven think kid guilti twelfth isnt sure director sidney lumet make directori debut he overli fond riledup actor shout camera doesnt stray prove path celebr play reginald rose that plu materi stand quit well the claustrophob muggi atmospher rife tension henri fonda tower saniti voic reason the film attempt substitut electr live perform mani tight shot angri sweati face spit yell howev ensembl cast rich anticamaraderi put film across,Neutral

"For its time, this movie must've been excellent. However, today it holds up as a good older movie that was filmed in black and white with many other older films in its time, shortly before, and shortly after surpassing it. Films such as Casablanca, Vertigo, North by Northwest, Gone With the Wind, Some Like It Hot, Sunset Boulevard, and many others are equally as good for this time period, and some are much better.

While I did appreciate and respect the movie and even liked it, I was very surprised at how high it was ranked on here at number five. There were no major plot twists, surprises, or even tour de force performances that you would also see in some other black and white older films. The concept was very interesting and kept my attention, but even some of the arguments and deductions that the jurors made were not truly logical. Some of them were intelligent, like when Henry Fonda measured the amount of time it would take for the older man witness to walk to the door, as well as when he proved he could purchase the weapon, but overall some of the points made were guesswork.

The truth is that at the end of the day, the director decides to paint Fonda's character as an ideal perfect person while clealry letting the culprit, likely guilty, walk free, which I felt betrayed the script's ambiguity. And to be totally honest, it would have been a much better movie, warranting a ranking of five all-time, if there was a plot twist that one of the juror's arguing for guilt was indeed the actual culrpit- a twist I was waiting and hoping for that I never got. Instead, we get a glorification of Fonda's character to the very end, ironically an antihero that wasn't truly meant to be that allowed the guilty one walk free.

"Title: ""12 Angry Men: A Timeless Masterpiece""In an age where the allure of modern blockbusters often overshadows the cinematic treasures of the past, Sidney Lumet's ""12 Angry Men"" stands as a testament to the enduring power of classic cinema. Released in 1957, this timeless masterpiece continues to captivate audiences with its gripping narrative and timeless themes. At first glance, the premise may seem simple: twelve jurors are tasked with deciding the fate of a young man accused of murder. But as the deliberations unfold within the confines of a claustrophobic jury room, the film delves deep into the complexities of human nature, exploring themes of prejudice, justice, and the power of empathy. What sets ""12 Angry Men"" apart is its masterful storytelling and impeccable craftsmanship. Shot almost entirely within the confines of a single room, the film relies on dialogue and character development to drive the narrative forward. Each juror brings their own biases and preconceptions to the table, leading to heated debates and intense confrontations that lay bare the flaws and foibles of the human condition. As the tension mounts and the stakes grow higher, the true brilliance of ""12 Angry Men"" shines through. Through the lens of the jury room, the film holds a mirror up to society, forcing viewers to confront their own prejudices and assumptions. In doing so, it transcends the confines of its era, offering timeless insights into the nature of justice and the power of collective action. But perhaps the greatest strength of ""12 Angry Men"" lies in its ability to resonate with audiences across generations. Despite being over six decades old, the film remains as relevant today as it was upon its release. Its exploration of themes such as systemic bias and the importance of due process continues to strike a chord in an age marked by social and political turmoil. Moreover, the performances of the cast elevate ""12 Angry Men"" to a level of cinematic excellence rarely seen. Led by Henry Fonda as Juror 8, the ensemble cast delivers performances that are as nuanced as they are compelling. Each actor brings depth and authenticity to their role, breathing life into characters that transcend the confines of the screen. As the credits roll and the final verdict is reached, ""12 Angry Men"" leaves an indelible impression on the viewer. It is a film that challenges conventions and defies expectations, reminding us of the power of cinema to provoke thought and inspire change. In a world inundated with flashy special effects and CGI-laden spectacles, ""12 Angry Men"" serves as a reminder of the timeless appeal of storytelling in its purest form. It is a film that reminds us of the importance of empathy, understanding, and the pursuit of justice - values that are as relevant today as they were in 1957. In conclusion, ""12 Angry Men"" is not just a movie; it is a timeless masterpiece that continues to captivate and inspire audiences with its powerful message and masterful execution.

"12 Angry Men is a very different thriller, it isn't even classified as one here on IMDb. But it is still a thriller nontheless, since it thrills, and boy does it thrill well !

It has no hidden bombs ready to detonate, no climactic shootout, no heroes getting imprisoned in the lair of the villains, but the suspense comes from one simple thing: the dialouge.

12 Angry Men is built on one of the better screenplays I have seen, and that is quite a feat since 90% of the movie takes place in one single room. But that is perhaps what makes it so tense and so great; the fact that you are stuck in one room with twelve very differing jurors divided into two groups, each of them trying to debunk the arguments of the opposing side over one question; is a teen convicted of first-degree murder guilty, or not guilty ? The heated conversations between the twelve delivers constant curveballs and plot twists, some quite shocking.

What I also love about the movie is the fact that it all seems like one take (comparisons can be made with the recent 1917 (2019), but perhaps not to the same extent). The excellent editing and the brilliant acting by all twelve jurors make sure of this.

I have seen people complaining over the lack of music in 12 Angry Men, but in my opinion, the dialouge serves as the music, if that makes any sense. It is a pure delight to listen to.

To conclude, 12 Angry Men is one of the best and most suspenseful movies I have ever seen, but in a very different way. It is a great shame that it is not as widely avaliable as some other highly rated IMDb titles, but perhaps that only adds to its factor of exclusivity.

After 20 minutes I could already see the end of the movie. Also I thought it a stretch that Henry Fonda's character could be so persuasive simply by standing his ground and saying 'maybe he's guilty and maybe he isn't.'

Perhaps its high IMDb rating is because a lot of people agree with the moral message it preaches. Maybe the moral message is 10 star but the movie is not.

-First Time Watch-

I watched this movie over the course of three days in my American Government class. By the end of the movie, more then half my class loved it. I didn't like it as much. Earlier this year we had watched 'Mr. Smith Goes to Washington' starring James Stewart. I found that one much more enjoyable since the characters did more then just sit around a table and discussing if a young boy really did kill his father or not. The story was slow, with a few surprises here and there but nothing spectacular. Our government teacher told us it was one of the best movies ever, according to the movie critics of that time, but I would have to disagree with the critics. It was just okay. Was it good to show to better understand the legal system? Yes. But, just for a movie to watch after a long week? Better keep looking.

"In a Hollywood oversaturated with Star Wars, Jurassic Park, and superhero movies, the idea of a talented small group making a movie on a budget, sounds mortifying. 12 Angry Men proves not only that it can be done, but it can make one of the best films ever.

The movie begins with a judge telling 12 jurors to decide the fate of an accused boy. Then the 12 jurors go to a room to discuss the trial. And after they decide the boys fate the movie ends. Get a cast and crew of 20 talented people, and you can make it yourself.

The jurors discuss at length the events of the trial, as well as the crime which lead to it, all without any flashback scenes. When I first heard of it, I was worried it was going to be boring, but with strong performances from all jurors, great camera work, and a compelling case, I found myself under the trance of this masterpiece.

It's not always a comfortable movie. The jurors are constantly yelling, the camera is claustrophobic, and the characters get sweaty, and it captures the jurors just perfectly. The case was interesting enough to begin with, but as new evidence presents itself, the film constantly gets more fascinating as it progresses.

12 Angry Men is a film with a story to tell and it doesn't need a huge budget to tell it. I highly recommend, especially to the filmmakers of the future.",in hollywood oversatur star war jurass park superhero movi idea talent small group make movi budget sound mortifi angri men prove done make one best film ever the movi begin judg tell juror decid fate accus boy then juror go room discus trial and decid boy fate movi end get cast crew talent peopl make the juror discus length event trial well crime lead without flashback scene when i first heard i worri go bore strong perform juror great camera work compel case i found tranc masterpiec it alway comfort movi the juror constantli yell camera claustrophob charact get sweati captur juror perfectli the case interest enough begin new evid present film constantli get fascin progress angri men film stori tell doesnt need huge budget tell i highli recommend especi filmmak futur,Positive
"This movie makes you wonder whether the jury system is the best way of deciding the outcome of a court case. Twelve ""ordinary"" men and women decide the fate of the defendant - how many are objective about the process? Some bring personal prejudices into the jury room - others couldn't care less about the outcome. These points are effectively raised in the movie.

Even though the action is confined to one room, the dialogue kept me riveted to the screen till the end. All the actors portrayed the different personalities of the jurors very well.",thi movi make wonder whether juri system best way decid outcom court case twelv ordinari men woman decid fate defend mani object process some bring person prejudic juri room other couldnt care less outcom these point effect rais movi even though action confin one room dialogu kept rivet screen till end all actor portray differ person juror well,Positive
"The concept of 'Reasonable Doubt' is highly pervasive within the Judicial System; it is the concept that eventually decides the fates of the accused, and is the concept that is one of the most controversial. It's controversy lies in the fact that it is purely subjective, and dependent on the individuals that comprise the jury. The notion of Reasonable Doubt has no one definition, yet it is almost universally known. In 12 ANGRY MEN, Sidney Lumet successfully gives the viewer an idea of how this concept comes into play in a trial.

It is worth noting that while this may be one of the best courtroom movies of all time, it doesn't in fact occur in the actual courtroom; all but 3 or 4 minutes of this Motion Picture is spent in the confines of a Jury Room, where the verdict is hotly debated. Lumet does well to present the Room as a sort of confinement from which there is no escape until a unanimous verdict is decided. As the film progresses, the sense of urgency and claustrophobia sets in, and the tension becomes increasingly high. The first technique Lumet used was to employ the locked door. The second was to cue the rain, which gives the feeling that even the outdoors are 'inaccessible' and that only the Room exists. The third technique may be missed by less astute viewers; Lumet switches his scope from wide to narrow to close-up during the movie, which adds to the claustrophobic feeling mentioned earlier.

The acting is top-notch, as required by any good character study. All 12 men have been developed to some appreciable extent, but the key players have been developed to a comprehensive level given the film's ~95 minute run-time. Henry Fonda is brilliant as the 'hesitant' juror, but to me Lee J. Cobb outshines him in almost every scene (save the opening scenes).

Another aspect of the film worth mentioning is the Music (or lack thereof). This is another intentional ploy by Lumet to give the viewer a 'feel' of the Room. There is no Music in the Jury Room, so why should there be in this film? I agree that while a musical background score serves to enhance or capture the mood of the scene, sometimes the absence of the music (silence) speaks volumes, by allowing the viewer to concentrate fully on the scene(s). One of my favourite movies lacking in music is NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN. Another brilliant score-less Motion Picture is CAST AWAY, where no music is used for the entire length of time that Tom Hanks is stranded.

The screenplay is solid and intelligently sound. In fact the only thing that stopped this film from winning Best Picture, Best Director, and Best Screenplay was the excellent THE BRIDGE ON THE RIVER KWAI. Had the movie been made a year or two earlier, it may well have won the esteemed accolades.

I can see why this film ranks in IMDb's All-time Top 10. It is simply a brilliant Motion Picture that has wide appeal, and can be enjoyed and appreciated by many.

4 stars (out of 4). 8/10. Will appear in my Top 200 at around 167 or so.

"I have tried, and tried again to like this film. But I fail after the first fifteen minutes. For a start it is a Henry Fonda vehicle based on a television play. And sadly it still looks like and feels like a television play. The line up of actors like Ed Begley, Lee J. Cobb etc is impressive and they act well if over theatrically. Fonda is Fonda and I repeat he is the star and he does his best to shrug off his usual coldness on film. I have nothing against his acting except that I do not respond to his way of performing. A little more warmth, and being less dour I would perhaps, and it is a big perhaps, to respond to him better. So this for me is one of the fault lines in the film and his stabbing a knife on the table is a great moment. Being a big star the moment has tremendous impact, and no doubt most audiences are caught. As for the plot of the film it is about a youth who has to all intents committed a murder and twelve jurors debate about his going to the electric chair or not. I know it was 1957 and just maybe it was too daring to ask but no one questions capital punishment in itself, and twelve angry men could dispute that in itself but of course it is not on the table. The film is often praised for its camera movements, claustrophobic towards the end and less so at the beginning. The only unintended humour for me was one of the more elderly men taking too long in the toilet. Or bathroom in ' respectable ' terms and the latter is of course used. No spoilers to the ending. But with signposts all the way a child could work it out. I also have not read in any reviews of this ' great ' film that the jurors are all baying for blood, and to get out of the room on a hot day as soon as possible. My opinion is I know a minority one, but for me the film does not dare to even question the biggest of all basic and human issues and that is if capital punishment is right or wrong in itself.",i tri tri like film but i fail first fifteen minut for start henri fonda vehicl base televis play and sadli still look like feel like televis play the line actor like ed begley lee j cobb etc impress act well theatric fonda fonda i repeat star best shrug usual cold film i noth act except i respond way perform a littl warmth less dour i would perhap big perhap respond better so one fault line film stab knife tabl great moment be big star moment tremend impact doubt audienc caught a plot film youth intent commit murder twelv juror debat go electr chair i know mayb dare ask one question capit punish twelv angri men could disput cours tabl the film often prais camera movement claustrophob toward end less begin the unintend humour one elderli men take long toilet or bathroom respect term latter cours use no spoiler end but signpost way child could work i also read review great film juror bay blood get room hot day soon possibl my opinion i know minor one film dare even question biggest basic human issu capit punish right wrong,Positive

"I am writing this review before reading any of the others, so as not to be influenced by them.

When I saw this film almost two decades ago I was absolutely riveted by the powerful, intense, unrelenting drama and suspense and the profound ethical content, not to mention the artistically uncompromising, sparse esthetics. The last scene, when Fonda walks out into the fresh air and gives a fond glance to the immense pillars of justice caused me to shed some tears, because I wasn't sure if I shared his abiding faith in the ultimate triumph of JUSTICE. In memory, the power of this film has faded, because it seems too comically optimistic. Justice ALWAYS triumphs in the end. It's a well-meaning, compassionate message, but it is also irresponsible. (Or is the message perhaps, that compassionate people should participate in juries more often?) True ethics and jurisprudence cannot afford such facile confidence. There is an insidious equation of law with justice. Every true legal mind, knows that the letter of the law can overwhelm the spirit of the law. Justice is just too big a topic for a movie!

"The only bad thing about this movie is that it ends, leaving the viewer with a bitter question : ""why aren't there movies like this anymore?"" No need for extravagant sets, no need for more than one room for the entire history of human race to unfold before our eyes. Looking inside of us, personally and as a species, we can all identify each and every one of the jurors. We all have acted indifferently, got carried away with anger, or with prejudice. We all are (or should be) capable of standing out for just causes like Henry Fonda's character. It's a question of choice, ethic and circumstance.

"Generally I consider one time enough to watch a movie, but this movie has so much depth in the dialogue that I felt I could watch it again right after it finished.

It is a deep dive in human psychology and how facts are perceived depending on the social surrounding. How each person sees the world from their own unique viewpoint. We will all recognize ourselves in one character or another and we see people we know portrayed on screen.

Now I did read a review about the high morality and feel-good vibe., but that is not really the essence of it. We will have to admit that, even though we want, we are unlikely that one person willing to stand up against everyone else. Probably most of us are like the majority of the group. Only willing to speak when we feel we have been granted safety by someone else willing to stand up against the loud people that overwhelm us. That makes the story feel real and engaging. It shows how quick people get drawn into the argumentation of those who simply are loud and confident. Most people are willing to listen provided they are granted the chance to be heard themselves. You have to dive deep and give them a chance to draw their own conclusions, within their own viewpoint. Forcing your argument only lasts as long as the receiver allows it.

"This film is a must see! No bells and whistles here, just the clear suspenseful plot of 12 men negotiating the future of a young man charged with murdering his father. Simply made, this black and white classic is nearly exclusively filmed in the confines of a small, hot, and miserable jurors room.

Juror #8, played by Henry Fonda, sets the standard initially with the sole ""Not Guilty"" vote. Each character then has to do some serious soul-searching to remove personal bias, conformity, and arrogance to properly perform their civic duty of determining the accused youth's fate. Sidney Lumet masterfully composes an instant classic by giving the viewers an inner look at individual and group conflict along with conflict resolution. This film is a great case study for communication styles for individuals and groups, as well.

Award winning acting, simplistic yet revealing dialogue, and before it's time camera angles and editing join together beautifully to create a suspense driven plot without the use of action, color, special effects, or an expensive budget.",thi film must see no bell whistl clear suspens plot men negoti futur young man charg murder father simpli made black white classic nearli exclus film confin small hot miser juror room juror play henri fonda set standard initi sole not guilti vote each charact seriou soulsearch remov person bia conform arrog properli perform civic duti determin accus youth fate sidney lumet master compos instant classic give viewer inner look individu group conflict along conflict resolut thi film great case studi commun style individu group well award win act simplist yet reveal dialogu time camera angl edit join togeth beauti creat suspens driven plot without use action color special effect expens budget,Positive
"However, collective intelligence and laborious pursuit of the truth itself sometimes take people near the truth. Twelve jurors are simplified integration of almost all types of people you can see in real life. Emotional one, smart one, reasonable one, wise one, rambling one, indecisive one, coward one, quiet one, loud one, and etc. I have never seen a movie with such a limited story and the setting. The whole move takes place in one setting: jurors' room and has one simple narrative: deciding defendant's guilt or innocence. However, it contains the whole society: how one's conviction can work in right or wrong way, what it takes to change others' opinions, what percentage of proportion is perfect between conviction and possibility, and how an individual deems 'the life'.

One thing I have particularly noticed is the temperature in the room and the weather outside. Because the room is stuffed, and all jurors are sweating, stress, pressure and unpleasantness in decision making process is thoroughly conveyed to the audience. The level of griminess peaks when the vote reaches six to six. Then, it rains, and a fan starts to work, forecasting pleasant momentum toward resolution or settlement. I also want to praise the camera work. It intensifies the sense of confined space without disturbing actors' delivery of emotion. When it is the vital moment of discovery of evidence, the camera closes up the actor with the line. However, other times, scenes are shot across the room vertically, emphasizing the narrowness with many people overlapping some parts of their body.

I will not deny '12 Angry Men' is philosophical art. However, it does not do enough to overcome the weakness this movie is born with, no dynamics and too linear because of finite story and setting. It misses out on most of what 'motion pictures' can offer.",howev collect intellig labori pursuit truth sometim take peopl near truth twelv juror simplifi integr almost type peopl see real life emot one smart one reason one wise one rambl one indecis one coward one quiet one loud one etc i never seen movi limit stori set the whole move take place one set juror room one simpl narr decid defend guilt innoc howev contain whole societi one convict work right wrong way take chang other opinion percentag proport perfect convict possibl individu deem life one thing i particularli notic temperatur room weather outsid becaus room stuf juror sweat stress pressur unpleas decis make process thoroughli convey audienc the level grimi peak vote reach six six then rain fan start work forecast pleasant momentum toward resolut settlement i also want prais camera work it intensifi sen confin space without disturb actor deliveri emot when vital moment discoveri evid camera close actor line howev time scene shot across room vertic emphas narrow mani peopl overlap part bodi i deni angri men philosoph art howev enough overcom weak movi born dynam linear finit stori set it miss motion pictur offer,Positive

But as the story unfolds you get to see more and more of the Jury's personality, through the way they behave and what they say. The writers of this movie did an amazing job creating twelve so distinctly different characters, and that's what makes this movie interesting.

"I love my kino, and love my classics, so let's get down to brass tacks as to why I give this a 6.

* The movie is timeless. It could have been shot in any decade.

* The movie was well ahead of its time in terms of photography

... and that's about it.

But, just like the jurors in ""12AM"", we must look beyond the 'facts'.

* First, the acting. It's superb at times, and really quaint not-in-a-good way in others. So while the photography has not aged one bit, the acting and the characterization has.

* Second, the plot line. There's so much good stuff in there, it's so well paced, that it's too easy to overlook the bad: the ending is as flat as they come (bombastic trumpets of the victor leaving the court in his white suit, really?), and the ""Kaiser Sauze"" moment that's hinted at from the beginning never comes. Ergo, it's didactic, and ergo, it's not that ""mind blowing"" at all.

* Third, it's a movie that's getting a lot of good ratings because of the current political climate. It's easy to call this timeless while taking down a disney attraction because it's linked to ""Song of the South"". It's also convenient to honour a movie that references the constitution amendment while ignoring that 2A is a thing. Funny how college in the US pick their 'Timeless classics"".

If someone asked you to create a compelling film, shot in only one location, black and white, a dozen actors, no fancy camera work, almost non-stop dialogue, and based entirely on an argument, could you do it?

Well, 12 Angry Men rises to that exact occasion. If you're one that appreciates some mystery, drama, a rollercoaster of a ride, you'll enjoy this movie. Granted it's not for all, its lack of action, romance or Michael Bay explosions may have some falling asleep, but to those who appreciate a good thriller, it'll have you on the edge of your seat the whole time.

It's easy to become desensitized today about what truly makes a good movie, with CGI a norm, relying solely on A list actors and actresses instead of a good screenplay prolific, we forget just how powerful well-written dialogue is. It's that dialogue that transports you into this movie, that thrusts you into the whirlwind of plot and emotion and doesn't let go until the movie's over. You walk away from this film in awe, not thinking well if 100 million dollars falls in my lap I could make a movie like that. No, you start thinking, damn, I have no excuse, this movie proves that it's story that matters, not extravagant displays of big budgets. And I feel that needs to be celebrated, acknowledged, and loved.",person rate if someon ask creat compel film shot one locat black white dozen actor fanci camera work almost nonstop dialogu base entir argument could well angri men rise exact occas if your one appreci mysteri drama rollercoast ride youll enjoy movi grant lack action romanc michael bay explos may fall asleep appreci good thriller itll edg seat whole time it easi becom desensit today truli make good movi cgi norm reli sole a list actor actress instead good screenplay prolif forget power wellwritten dialogu it dialogu transport movi thrust whirlwind plot emot doesnt let go movi you walk away film awe think well million dollar fall lap i could make movi like no start think damn i excus movi prove stori matter extravag display big budget and i feel need celebr acknowledg love,Positive
"What is there to be said that hasn't already been said? It's earned it's status as a classic for a reason. While I wouldn't go so far as to call it one of the greatest of all time, it is a vastly entertaining take on a brilliant premise that has been used throughout the decades sense. The dialogue is sharp, the character turns are believable and interesting and the whole thing flows along at a swift pace. When it was over I couldn't believe that so much time had gone by. I'm always fascinated by films that take place entirely in one location (or almost entirely) and this was one of the early precedents for the kind of greatness one can accomplish when that is utilized properly.

The ominous surroundings like the heat and the storm add nice bits of tension to the rising tempers of the men in the room and the confrontations between the soft Henry Fonda and the explosive Lee J. Cobb were intense. Sidney Lumet is a man who earned his reputation as an ""actor's director"" and made his career out of mostly setting up the stage and aiding his actors in doing what they do best, but I think his stylistic choices here deserve to be commended. The way that he slowly brings the camera down over the course of the film, bringing us more intimately into the heart of this room, it adds that sense of claustrophobia that makes the tension even more gripping as we proceed into the later stages of it all.

Practically everyone in the cast shines at one point or another, my favorites being the commanding Fonda who is able to be the voice of reason without being annoying, the pensive E.G. Marshall, the racist and volatile Ed Begley and the wise, determined Joseph Sweeney. The film had plenty of great twists, like the knife reveal, but my favorite scene had to be Begley going off on his offensive monologue while one-by-one the jurors turned away from him until he realized that his ignorance had caused him to lose any voice he once had; a powerfully real moment. I also loved the added touch of putting Fonda in an all white suit while everyone else was in shades of black or grey.",what said hasnt alreadi said it earn statu classic reason while i wouldnt go far call one greatest time vastli entertain take brilliant premis use throughout decad sen the dialogu sharp charact turn believ interest whole thing flow along swift pace when i couldnt believ much time gone im alway fascin film take place entir one locat almost entir one earli preced kind great one accomplish util properli the omin surround like heat storm add nice bit tension rise temper men room confront soft henri fonda explos lee j cobb intens sidney lumet man earn reput actor director made career mostli set stage aid actor best i think stylist choic deserv commend the way slowli bring camera cours film bring u intim heart room add sen claustrophobia make tension even grip proceed later stage practic everyon cast shine one point anoth favorit command fonda abl voic reason without annoy pensiv eg marshal racist volatil ed begley wise determin joseph sweeney the film plenti great twist like knife reveal favorit scene begley go offens monologu onebyon juror turn away realiz ignor caus lose voic power real moment i also love ad touch put fonda white suit everyon el shade black grey,Positive
"Here's a film made only in a room that looks hot and humid and only on a budget of $349,000. The twelve jurors must decide unanimously on a case of first degree murder whether the accused is guilty or not guilty. When they walk into a jury room which is both hot and humid they become acquainted with the personalities of their peers at first.Then they do a vote with the motive of finishing that taken-for granted murder case.However right at that moment they realize that one of the jurors doesn't like the quick open and shut situation of the case and he says ""it needed to be talked"" based on his reasonable doubt! Because it's not an unanimous voting the case need to be talked then a whole set of serious arguments ensues.Sifting of the evidence disclose the errors of the prosecution's case, the doubtful representation by the defendant's court-appointed attorney, and the true inner-deep character of each of the jury members.Well that's what I love just a room twelve people..one man a lone dissenter force the others to think why they vote yes why they don't no.He forces them to share a responsibility and he is even tactful enough to mention that the accused kid has been subjected to violence..that he needs more than just a fair-looking trial before sending him to the chair.Henry Fonda as the cool,calm and wise questioning one dissenter is just awesome the other 11 days are good too but Joseph Sweeney as the wise and observant elderly man named McCardle caught my attention too!

"This marvelous story from the late 50s, is about a juror(Henry Fonda) who along with 11 other jurors, try to come up with a reasonable verdict for a murder trial. He believes that the accused in this case is innocent and in the beginning, he is the only person who has this particular opinion. Later on in this powerful tale, he manages to persuade the other jurors that the accused might be innocent with his skills of analyzing legal matters.

What surprised me the most was this: Usually, courtroom dramas often begin with a shot of the crime scene that took place whereas this movie starts directly with the jurors' discussion. It doesn't even have a trial but still has a capability to mesmerize people's minds with just ONE shot in ONE room. The heated discussion between the jurors along with the twists and turns in the statements of the witness, makes this movie greatly enthralling. I watched this movie with my family and all of us got so indulged in the movie that we found every scene fascinating. Besides, all the actors did a fabulous job being in a different character's shoe. Each juror had different thoughts and approaches towards the matter and the actors wonderfully embodied it.

Thus, I think that this flawless movie is a must-watch for every person who adores trials and courtroom dramas.",thi marvel stori late jurorhenri fonda along juror tri come reason verdict murder trial he believ accus case innoc begin person particular opinion later power tale manag persuad juror accus might innoc skill analyz legal matter what surpris usual courtroom drama often begin shot crime scene took place wherea movi start directli juror discus it doesnt even trial still capabl mesmer peopl mind one shot one room the heat discus juror along twist turn statement wit make movi greatli enthral i watch movi famili u got indulg movi found everi scene fascin besid actor fabul job differ charact shoe each juror differ thought approach toward matter actor wonder embodi thu i think flawless movi mustwatch everi person ador trial courtroom drama,Neutral
"12 Angry Man is a brilliant movie about the value of a human life. Essentially, it is a discussion between 12 jurors who must decide on the life of a young man. The film takes place in real time and deals with important issues such as human morality and the fact that our decisions are shaped by our own experiences, prejudices and even selfishness. Each of the 12 men is different, has a unique profession that reflects his personality, and has had his own experiences in life. As a viewer, it's just exciting to see each perspective and how each one tries to argue.

"A great film. I've only even seen parts at different times. I always meant to sit down and watch the whole thing, but too much to do lately, I work. Luckily, AMC is showing it often, so maybe I'll see the whole thing.

But for now - here are my thoughts: Henry Fonda is superb - did the kid really do it? I still don't know. But the character actor suppport is audacious! Everyone is in there - Jack Klugman, Ed Begley, Sr., Martin Balsam, Jack Warden, E.G. Marhshall, what more can we want in black and white? That's when the camera operators show their greatness.

I think 1939 was the greatest film year of all - Grapes of Wrath, Wizard of Oz, and the very special Gone With the Wind.

I watch old black and whites whenever I can - Bette Davis, Claudette Colbert, Veronica Lake (So Proudly We Hail), Lauren Bacall, Clark Gable (my favorite), Humphrey Bogart (Deadline USA'52 is a favorite besides Casablanca), James Stewart (FBI Story one of his best here), they are all the greats. Not one to touch them these days.

"It seems that this movie is unanimously a masterpiece, a 9/10, and according to the list, the #5 best movie of all time according to IMDB.

I'm going to be the dissenting juror to this conviction. While the movie is undoubtedly very good for its time and for being a black and white movie, I believe it is overrated at its score and where it sits in the top 5. I'm astonished this is as high ranked and rated actually.

It's like the jurors in the room pressuring everybody to side with their opinion, and anybody who doesn't agree with their assertion is outcasted and must give into peer pressure and consent to a 9/10. However, not me, I give this very good movie a 7/10, and I could see it in the 90-100 ranked range, maybe the 50 range at best.

There is practically no action, no big twists, and no grand surprises. There were just a couple of scenes such as where Fonda's character pulls out the knife or when the angry juror demonstrates the angle of the knife on Fonda that created some tension, but most of it is too even and simplistic to be considered great. Sure, the arguments brought up by the characters were often interesting and valid, but they were just using step by step logic that wasn't overly cerebral. That's fine, but the point is that there was no big mindblowing 'aha' moment. It was just a step by step chiseling of the evidence that was again interesting at some times, but at others it was just basic.

There was definitely a lot to learn from in this movie in terms of how a jury works if one has never been on one, as well as how the system works regarding arriving at verdicts. I'm sure for its time, it was very enlightening for people unfamiliar with the constitution, and even today there are timeless elements to the study of the situation.

I have one more minor criticism. While Fonda's acting was good, I found his character to be a little bit too much portrayed like an angel. The director even has him place the most angry juror's jacket on him at the end, and the camera just about solely focuses in on him at the end. They didn't even include the reading of the final verdict or show the boy's or the attorneys' reactions or the courtroom's. I mean, come on, Fonda's character may have just convinced eleven other men to let the culprit walk free, and yet the director paints him as a basically perfect person, like an angel. I think this betrays the script in a sense because there was ample evidence that the boy was guilty, not because of the pathetic prejudicial arguments or preconceptions of character, but because of some other key pieces of evidence. For example, just because juror four can't remember the exact name of the movie he saw or struggles to recall the actor names shouldn't be enough to disregard the boy's statements. I'm not saying he was definitely guilty, but the way the script was playing out, I don't think it was clear enough to pain Fonda's character as this perfect person the way they did, especially at the end, although this could be a trope of the times in the 1950's to always have a hero be idealized.

In summation, it is a very good movie, but I probably wouldn't watch it again as it is rather monotonous with very little action if any at all and very few twists. Still, I'm glad I watched it once and would put it in the top 30 or so of black and white movies, but definitely not in the top 5 movies of all time. Just off the top of my head, Casablanca, It's a Wonderful Life, The Birds, Rear Window, Vertigo, and Gone With the Wind are better older movies than this was.",it seem movi unanim masterpiec accord list best movi time accord imdb im go dissent juror convict while movi undoubtedli good time black white movi i believ overr score sit top im astonish high rank rate actual it like juror room pressur everybodi side opinion anybodi doesnt agre assert outcast must give peer pressur consent howev i give good movi i could see rank rang mayb rang best there practic action big twist grand surpris there coupl scene fonda charact pull knife angri juror demonstr angl knife fonda creat tension even simplist consid great sure argument brought charact often interest valid use step step logic wasnt overli cerebr that fine point big mindblow aha moment it step step chisel evid interest time other basic there definit lot learn movi term juri work one never one well system work regard arriv verdict im sure time enlighten peopl unfamiliar constitut even today timeless element studi situat i one minor critic while fonda act good i found charact littl bit much portray like angel the director even place angri juror jacket end camera sole focus end they didnt even includ read final verdict show boy attorney reaction courtroom i mean come fonda charact may convinc eleven men let culprit walk free yet director paint basic perfect person like angel i think betray script sen ampl evid boy guilti pathet prejudici argument preconcept charact key piec evid for exampl juror four cant rememb exact name movi saw struggl recal actor name shouldnt enough disregard boy statement im say definit guilti way script play i dont think clear enough pain fonda charact perfect person way especi end although could trope time alway hero ideal in summat good movi i probabl wouldnt watch rather monoton littl action twist still im glad i watch would put top black white movi definit top movi time just top head casablanca it wonder life the bird rear window vertigo gone with wind better older movi,Positive

To be honest, I think some of the dialog and a couple of the plot points are weak, but Lumet's direction keeps the movie moving seamlessly forward. All the actors are good, with Ed Begley, EG Marshall and Henry Fonda particularly so. It is Lee J. Cobb, however, that stands out for me. So powerful yet nuanced. Near the end, after Cobb recounts ""every single"" reason he thinks the kid is guilty, John Fiedler says ""You said we could throw out all the other evidence"" Cobb's reaction of bewilderment and frustration rang so true I have a hard time believing he was acting.

"It's a movie that takes place in one hot, smoke-filled, sweaty room, at a time when men felt naked if they took their jacket and tie off. 11 come into the room wanting to fry the defendant; one man starts pointing out all the ambiguous testimony. He nobly upholds the concept of ""reasonable doubt."" Guess who triumphs?

The movie is remarkable. Sidney Lumet was even then a master filmmaker. The claustrophobia is palpable, but the camera is fluid enough to give you every angle on the closed, locked room, and every emotion and bead of sweat on the men trapped there.

The story, however, presents easy heroes and villains: the everyman just trying to make sure justice is done; the bigot who can't keep his opinions to himself; the noble immigrant. Cliches all, even back in 1957.

Yet, the cast is so real. These are real, sweaty, down-to-earth actors putting on the performances of their lives. You always feel like you are in there with them, following the logic, thinking about whether the evidence presented is believable.

"12 men debating over the fate of a boy who was suspected of killing his father. 12 different personalities and an array of interests, the debates portrayed the importance of listening, understanding, respect and empathy.

It is vital we disentangle perceptions and emotions from the problem. As perceptions are shaped by varied experiences and values, an array of perceptions is undeniable in any negotiation. However, allowing perceptions to determine our views on the problem at hand is detrimental as it not only leads to an obscuration of truth, but also an inaccurate basis upon which we make a decision. For example, Juror 10, with his preconceived prejudices against slum-dwellers as a result of his experience living among them, voted ""Guilty"". This prejudice undeniably resulted in a biased view, ignoring the fact that experiences are varied and more crucially, doing no justice to the boy. This is further compounded when his prejudice was taken as a personal attack by Juror 5 who lived in a slum before, engendering a flurry of emotions. In this regard, it is evident that perceptions and emotions are intricately entwined and it is crucial that we attack the problem, not the people (Fisher and Ury, 2012).

In light of varied perceptions, it is important that interests of individuals are made explicit. This is so as when we begin to ask ""WHY?"", inaccurate perceptions and selfish interests could be teased out, allowing us to see how each side has multiple interests. For example, within the ""Guilty"" side, a range of interests was noticed – where Juror 7's interest lied in wanting to ""get out of here"", while Juror 3's problematic interest stemmed from his strained relationship with his son.

"This film is superb, in fact as Shakespeare once said ""Its the bees' knees"". The film captivates the audience from the beginning. Each of the twelve jurors are introduced to us as they are introduced to themselves. The characters are well draw out and individual, each with his own personality.

The tension of the characters draws the audience in from the start. We imagine that the case is open and shut, 11 me saying guilty and 1 not. We feel the discomfort of Henry Fonda as the other characters belittle and mock how he can see any reasonable doubt in the case. But we also share his victories and the enthusiasm as he proceeds to refute or add doubt to the arguments for guilty and are captivated and draw in as other jurors begin to see doubt in the proceedings.

The audience can also see the arguments for guilty and wonder if Fonda's character is correct in saying that he doubts. Yet they also feel the shame of the characters as he disproves that a previously sound theory is iron tight, joining his side as members of the jury do.

On top of this they are wonderfully woven in human elements such as the misconceptions that influence people and the growing tension between different characters. This is brought to life even more by the amazing performances, Fonda, Lee J Cobb and Joseph Sweeney are of particular note.

I started watching this film on a bored relaxed laying about day but by the end i was on the edge of the seat with my hands on my knees feeling more tense than a politician on results day.

"12 Angry Men is a terrific film that reflects a lot of the past problems and the proposed solutions of immigration, youth violence, and of course, overcoming one's own background and discrimination. The film surprised me in how progressive it was, and the ending social conclusions that it reached.

In the film you can see clearly form a rift between the upper class, conservatives who are unwilling to change and the progressives who are proposing change for the better of all of us; this film, deep down, is a very class conscious and socially conscious film about discrimination and the deep lines it had in American society in 1957.

Although the film's portrayal is sometimes overly simplistic, drawing a ""stubborn, pig-headed"" conservative versus ""righteous, just"" progressive, one can find that this was very much so a necessary film for its' time. In many ways, it is a work that was socially far advanced.

Also what is interesting is the fact that it is a film that is done with great simplicity; some actors, and a room... It relies greatly upon the pure talent of the actors, and the great direction of Sidney Lumet -- this film is truly unique due to the true minimalism it embraces in its' production tactics, yet this is something that could easily go unnoticed due to the incredible quality of the film.",angri men terrif film reflect lot past problem propos solut immigr youth violenc cours overcom one background discrimin the film surpris progress end social conclus reach in film see clearli form rift upper class conserv unwil chang progress propos chang better u film deep class consciou social consciou film discrimin deep line american societi although film portray sometim overli simplist draw stubborn pighead conserv versu righteou progress one find much necessari film time in mani way work social far advanc also interest fact film done great simplic actor room it reli greatli upon pure talent actor great direct sidney lumet film truli uniqu due true minim embrac product tactic yet someth could easili go unnot due incred qualiti film,Positive
"Intense courtroom drama which has 12 very different people, all males, struggling with a murder case involving a young Puerto Rican boy that seems cut-and-dried. However, juror Henry Fonda does not believe it to be as sure-fire as it appears. He votes not guilty and what follows is a chain of events that will test the views, beliefs and thoughts of the other 11 members. Fonda is great, but Lee J. Cobb steals every scene (and that is not easy to do in a film like this). Ed Begley, Martin Balsam, Jack Warden, Jack Klugman, Joseph Sweeney, E.G.

The screenplay is sophisticated and smart, and the story is compelling and intelligent. The film is also brilliantly made, and the acting is superb. Henry Fonda especially dominates the film, with an integrity that makes his character so wonderful, but the other actors are wonderful as well, Ed Begley, Jack Warden, John Fiedler, Lee J Cobb, Rudy Bond et al. are all impeccable support to Fonda.

"Gosh, I don't know how many times I studied this play and performed it in high school, not to mention how many television shows had an episode that was inspired by 12 Angry Men. It was always a great drama because of the raw human emotions that were so true and remain timeless, this play will never be dated. I couldn't wait to see this movie when I saw it at the video store and it was the first movie I slipped into the DVD player. First off, I was incredibly impressed with the credits, we not only had Henry Fonda, we had Lee J. Cobb in the cast! This movie was so well performed and such a treasure, god, I couldn't ever say any words to justify it. I've done this a million times, but here is another summary of what 12 Angry Men is all about.

12 jurors are about to make a decision about a murder case, over all it seems like an open and shut case with tons of evidence that would make any good man look guilty, an 18 year old boy is about to be put to death if convicted. 11 of the men vote guilty, only one vote holds them back and they have to discuss the trial once again due to one vote being not guilty. Jurour #8 refuses to just jump to conclusions and brings up incredible possibilities that can always make a man think of ""reasonable doubts"", one by one the jurors begin to see the points he is making, except for one stubborn #3 who would rather just pull the switch to the chair himself.

12 Angry Men is a timeless tale that could either be told very badly, i.e. 7th Heaven, or incredibly well and bring out terrific performances like Henry and Lee did. Actually, the whole cast was terrific, there wasn't a performance that was off key, movies like this are so needed in Hollywood today, it was so simple, but added so much for a 30 minute play. Please, if you have any taste, you will truly enjoy 12 Angry Men and have a great appreciation for it!

"This is one of those movies where everything could go wrong. The story is as simple as it can be: 12 men are jurors on a open and shut murder trial, but one man thinks that another persons life deserves at least some thought on the matter and votes not guilty. From this point on we have 12 actors and a closed room. This could be the most boring film ever made. Lumet however is a master of mise-en-scene and provides a tense movie that keeps you locked on from the word ""go"". The dialogs are great and supported by incredibly talented actors. Joel Schumacher in Phone Booth needed to see this movie and draw a few ideas on how to make a character built, dialog driven movie.

"I could go on, but I thought I'd stop there before my summary line gets too big. Now just because this is a classic movie (and we really should try to use that term lightly, but this movie really deserves it and I'll elaborate on that), does not mean everybody will love it. And if one does not like it, it does not mean they have no taste. They just have different tastes, which is a good thing, because if every human on earth would have the same taste, life would be very boring now wouldn't it? The asnwer is yes, in case you were wondering.

But back to this, which begins outside and takes us inside. And it is important that we were outside because we will live inside a building (a room to be more specific) for the most time. There is also a brief shot of the alleged culprit/criminal. After that we get in a room with 12 men, who are quite different from each other. And while it wasn't yet time to give African American a chance in a movie like that (or Asian American for that matter), there is a critical racial line that is drawn. If you follow what is happening and who says what or argues in certain ways, you will see that this movie has quite the social commentary in it.

Now that is one part of this being genius, because it never rubs your nose in it. It never says, this guy who is i.e. from Italian descent has a reasonable thing/argument to say. No you just hear the things and see the people interact. And I have not even mentioned the way the movie is shot. And I'm not talking about the black and white cinematography (which is beautifully lit), no. I mean the framing and the set-ups. the editing and how everything flows. You feel like you're inside the room. You feel like this really happens or happened. Even the things that seem not staged (someone blocking another person, a shadow, peoples back and more) are in fact staged and masterfully done so.

There are way smarter people than me, that can list you many things this movie has done right and I'm sure there quite a few sources online to look for. Just listening to the audio commentary can give a small glimpse into certain things too. But again, since this is not something that one might call light entertaining, if it does not appeal to you, then it is so.

"This film deserves to be on anyone's list of top films. My problem is that it is so perfect, so seamlessly polished, it is hard to appreciate the individual excellences.

The acting is top notch. I believe that monologue acting is quite a bit simpler than real reactive ensemble acting. Most of what we see today is monologues pretending to be conversations. But in this film, we have utter mastery of throwing emotions. Once the air becomes filled with human essence, it is hard to not get soaked ourselves as the camera moves through the thick atmosphere. Yes, there are slight differences in how each actor projects (Fonda internally, Balsam completely on his skin...) but the ensemble presents one vision to the audience.

The writing is snappy too. You can tell it was worked and worked and worried, going through several generations. It is easy to be mesmerized by this writing and acting, and miss the rare accomplishment of the camera-work. This camera is so fluid, you forget you are in one room. It moves from being a human observer, to being omniscient, to being a target. It is smart enough to seldom center on the element of most importance, so expands the field to all men.

This is very hard. Very hard, to make the camera human. So much easier to do what we see today -- acknowledge the machinery and jigger with it. Do we have a filmmaker today who could do this?

"The plot of12 Angry Men revolves around the murder trail of a Latino boy who is accused of killing his father. The conviction of the boy would mean a death sentence and the destiny of the boy's life is in the hands of twelve male jurors of ranging personalities. The case seems open and shut with a murder weapon and several witnesses to place the boy at the scene of the crime. For eleven of the jurors the decision is apparent that the boy is guilty but for one juror, Mr. Davis (Henry Fonda), the boy's life should entail some discussion to eliminate any reasonable doubt the jurors may have. As the film progresses the personalities of the jurors become apparent and many underlying issues influence the guilty decision chosen by the majority of the jurors.

The underlying issues are the complexity of the personalities of the jurors and the reasons why they have the motivation to feel and act the way they do. As the case unfolds further, more is learned about each juror individually. The personalities range from being a short-tempered loud mouth to a straight- laced accountant who never breaks a sweat. As the movie progresses much more is learned of the characters that exposes the intricacy of human nature and people's different personality traits.

This film is an excellent example of movie making that does not require elaborate sets to entertain the viewer. The majority of the film takes place in a jury room with the men never leaving the room from their deliberation responsibilities. The cast and dialogue make this film memorable and the film has some clear moral issues that are addressed. The main issue is that not everything is as it seems. With further analysis the understanding of a situation becomes more concrete enabling the men to make a solid decision that affects a young man's life. 12 Angry Men is a classic film that should not be missed.",the plot angri men revolv around murder trail latino boy accus kill father the convict boy would mean death sentenc destini boy life hand twelv male juror rang person the case seem open shut murder weapon sever wit place boy scene crime for eleven juror decis appar boy guilti one juror mr davi henri fonda boy life entail discus elimin reason doubt juror may a film progress person juror becom appar mani underli issu influenc guilti decis chosen major juror the underli issu complex person juror reason motiv feel act way a case unfold learn juror individu the person rang shorttemp loud mouth straight lace account never break sweat a movi progress much learn charact expo intricaci human natur peopl differ person trait thi film excel exampl movi make requir elabor set entertain viewer the major film take place juri room men never leav room deliber respons the cast dialogu make film memor film clear moral issu address the main issu everyth seem with analysi understand situat becom concret enabl men make solid decis affect young man life angri men classic film miss,Neutral

"This film is my submission as the greatest ensemble cast performance in the HISTORY of CINEMA! As it was released when I was only 9 years old.... I have viewed it on multiple occasions... But to be honest, I cannot remember exactly when I saw it for the first time!

I must admit that the intricacies of jury duty selection in the New York area in the 1950's is something of which I know absolutely nothing about.... But I have often wondered if women, for some reason, were exempt from jury duty in New York 65 years ago!?!?!?

Leaving that issue aside, let's focus on the film itself. Some of the actors in the cast, like Henry Fonda, Lee J. Cobb and Ed Begley, were already well known when it was released in 1957. For Most of the others, their participation in this Classic certainly augmented their stature greatly! Although 12 ANGRY MEN was Nominated for Best Picture, Best Director and Best Adapted Screenplay, This Number 6 Highest Rated Movie of ALL-TIME, sadly, struck out at the Oscars... Winning nary a single Golden Statuette! I invite any and all of You reading my Review to focus on each and every astounding characterization rendered in this movie. With each viewing, I have come to appreciate and savor every detail, of every performance, all the more!

As someone who has seen thousands of movies, 12 ANGRY MEN lets You totally get into the head of each and every character... As almost no other film, before or since! 12, layer by layer, methodically peels away the facade that is part and parcel of our subconcious self-protection and insulation from letting ourselves become too vulnerable and over-exposed to scrutiny by others!

If You have never seen 12 ANGRY MEN... for whatever reason... or reasonS... You must place it at the very TOP of Your WATCH LIST!

"Shot in real time, this story of a jury trying to decide whether a young man is innocent or guilty never lets the viewer's attention go. Henry Fonda plays Juror #8, who is convinced the entire time that the defendant is innocent, while everyone else has already called him guilty. Throughout the movie, we not only get to hear everyone's opinions on the matter, but also every possibility of the verdict. With ""12 Angry Men"", Sidney Lumet brought to the screen the same kind of ""closing in"" feeling that he brought to movies like ""Network"". In the end, the issue is not whether the defendant is innocent or guilty; the important point is the process by which the jurors reached their decision.

"12 Angry Men may be the greatest film of the 1950's. It really is unlike other films, as it's takes place in mostly 1 location, over an hour and a half, and there's no actions - just a conversation. The acting just feels so natural, almost like they improvised the entire film. All the characters are distinct, and very memorable, especially juror 8.

Ultimately, the film is all about influencing a group, and how everything at face value shouldn't be taken for fact. Juror number 8, despite talking the least, has the most influence over the group. Everything that seems a fact, the eyewitness seeing the kid through the passing El train, can be rexamined, and twisted. The film shows the jurors to be tribalistic, and how some of the jurors' mostly strongly held beliefs are also their least challenged.

"Eleven to one, there is one enter dissenter among the Jury in the trial of a young man who's accused of murdering his father.

This for me is one of the greatest films of all time, it somehow never suffers as the years go past. Twelve men from different backgrounds, with different view points come together, their mission, to determine the guilt of one young man, it's an amiable start, but soon tempers begin to fly as the status quo is questioned.

I love that we're in for the kill as it were, we see no crime, or anything associated, everything we get is given to us by The Jurors, it is an incredible way of telling the story, I can't think of any other film that took this unique approach,

It scrutinises the many weaknesses people have, prejudices, preconceived ideas, anger and personal grievance, but it's balanced out by showing the exact opposite, bravery, faith, intelligence, the ability to listen and question. This film ranks as one of the best studies of human nature in existence.

If you've done jury service you'll relate to it, you have people that want to question, and you have people that want to get out of there and on with their lives as quickly as possible.

It's incredible to think of a time when Juries consisted of twelve whits men, it would have taken a brave man to be a single disagreeing voice.

"""12 Angry Men"" A chamber film about self-discovery.

""They have twelve pieces of paper... Twelve chances to kill!"" - tagline and the only thing I knew about the film. And that's what I'd like to shoot!

I love when the essence of the film sounds in the ""background"". We watch the jury deliberate on whether the boy is guilty of murdering his father, and we see each character's soul unfold. Based on emotions, thinking about the case by the words of his life problems, almost every character builds a monument of his character and breaks it into pieces. Juror 9's monologue about an old man who, at 79 years old, just wants to be heard, gets me every time. And with all prof. Deformation, I forget that I'm watching a movie.

And if you watched the movie and are waiting for comments about the case itself, facts and evidence - I have nothing to say. Many people have already done it for me.

"This movie is *not* a courtroom (or jury room) drama. It's about how a jury room can become a sanctuary that changes the lives of the jurors. It heavily implies that any place could become a place of metamorphosis if we only dug deeper with each other regarding each other's thoughts and beliefs.

What seems to be a closed case slowly unravels through deeper discussion. In the beginning, 11-1 is the vote in favor of guilty, a vote to send an 18 year old to the electric chair for murdering his father. One juror thinks there should be more discussion. He stands up to a lot of ridicule, but perseveres and slowly has his doubts vindicated as more jurors notice fishy things about the case and change their votes.",thi movi courtroom juri room drama it juri room becom sanctuari chang live juror it heavili impli place could becom place metamorphosi dug deeper regard other thought belief what seem close case slowli unravel deeper discus in begin vote favor guilti vote send year old electr chair murder father one juror think discus he stand lot ridicul persever slowli doubt vindic juror notic fishi thing case chang vote,Neutral
"This movie came out of an era that I really loved, when ensemble acting was so strong. We had a whole group of character actors who really took seriously the smaller roles that they had. The direction by Sidney Lumet on this film is outstanding. To take the Henry Fonda character from the meek, inconsequential juror, simply putting forth a theory, to watching the other men slowly see his way of thinking, is subtlety at its best. Lee J. Cobb does his burn, done in by impatience and inconvenience. Pusing an agenda that fits only him. Underlying the entire plot is the defendant whom we never see but get to know through a slow, methodical, yet fascinating series of revelations. It's quiet, suspenseful, and human.",thi movi came era i realli love ensembl act strong we whole group charact actor realli took serious smaller role the direct sidney lumet film outstand to take henri fonda charact meek inconsequenti juror simpli put forth theori watch men slowli see way think subtleti best lee j cobb burn done impati inconveni puse agenda fit underli entir plot defend never see get know slow method yet fascin seri revel it quiet suspens human,Positive
"A dissenting juror (Henry Fonda) in a murder trial slowly manages to convince the others (Jack Klugman , Martin Balsam , Jack Warden , Lee. J. Cobb , Ed Begley , E.G. Marshall , Robert Webber , among others) that the case is not as obviously clear as it seemed in court. As Juror #8 holds out with a verdict of not guilty, thus setting the stage for arguments and reasons why or why not the boy may be guilty . As he desperately seeks to convince his eleven peers to reconsider their hast conviction of a boy framed of murdering . As 12 jurors are struggling to decide the fate of a teenager who allegedly killed his father .

Made for television classic about twelve jurors quick to condemn a youth on trial for murdering his father before reviewing the evidence. Though the whole movie is set in a jury room it never lacks for taut , suspense , intrigue and inspired direction . The struggle behind closed doors is tense , charged and riveting . Reginald Rose's brilliant TV play script was left virtually intact in its move to feature film. This famous play from the 'Golden Age of Television' was splendidly directed by Sidney Lumet with an extraordinary plethora of actors who give magnificent performances .Because the painstaking rehearsals for the film lasted an exhausting two weeks, filming had to be completed in an unprecedented 21 days and shot in a total of 365 separate takes. However, nowadays none of the twelve stars are still alive . The acting level of the cast during some of the intense discussions and debates almost bursts in the screen . The movie is commonly used in business schools and workshops to illustrate team dynamics and conflict resolution techniques. Nominated for 3 Oscars , another 16 wins & 6 nominations ; the film lost out in all its categories to The Bridge on the River Kwai . It ranked #2 on the American Film Institute's list of the 10 greatest films in the genre ""Courtroom Drama"".

This Lumet's impressive debut was followed by a remake made for cable TV (1997) , a contemporized rendition of the memorable tale whose script has been slightly updated but the premise is the same , it was directed by William Friedkin with a formidable cast such as William L. Petersen, Edward James Olmos, Hume Cronyn, James Gandolfini, Dorian Harewood, Ossie Davis, and Courtney B. Vance , George C. Scott , Armin Mueller-Stahl , Tony Danza and Jack Lemmon takes on the voice of dissent , the Fonda role .

"I agree with many of the reviews- less is more, great cast of actors. Love the premise of just following the jury in the room. Honestly after the first 30 minutes you could kind of tell where this story line was headed and it wasn't much of a surprise at the end. I just don't see this movie in the same league as some of the others at the top of best movie lists- Shawshank, Godfather, Schindler's list, even Pulp Fiction. It's not just because it is a classic black and white movie, I love that about it. It's a Wonderful Life blows this away.

"A young ethnic kid from a rough area is up on a murder charge and to the jury of twelve men, it all seems a fairly open and shut case. So all are surprised when the votes come back with one ""not guilty"" in the pack. Juror #8 maintains he holds a reasonable doubt, much to the frustration of the rest of the group. The stalemate forces a debate over the details of the case which sees each man questioning others and themselves for their motivations and decisions. The heat in the room and the passage of time sees tensions rising by the minute.

I'm not a massive fan of the ""Movie You Must See"" podcast crew because they mostly tend to discuss the events in a film rather than really critiquing or reviewing it (although at times this ""mates in a pub"" approach is OK). Anyway, one of the advantages of having anyone pointing out ""films you should see"" is that it reminds you that you should these films. So it was for me as I listened to 12 Angry Men and realised that not only had I never reviewed it but that I had not actually watched it for many years. Of course mentally I knew it was a ""classic"" but did I really understand why it was? So when it came on television recently I watched it again with new eyes.

The films moves right into the jury room and pretty much this room is all we have for the duration. Initially the script does really well to have the viewer side with the majority because in the discussions the evidence does seem very clear cut and #8's doubts seem so general and non-specific. This is a good way to start because it means the viewer also has to question and we are taken along the journey just like the men in the jury. Gradually we get into the detail and doubts are tweaked out  not to the point of solving the crime because that is not what it is about but it is done in a way that is interesting and engaging. It is not perfect in this regards though because some of the jumps are big, some of the assumptions are stretching and some of the knowledge in the room is a little too convenient. However what weaknesses there are in the material are covered by the fact that the delivery is roundly quite brilliant.

Lumet directions from within the room and makes great use of such a small space. It feels like it could be a play (not sure if it was or not) but Lumet prevents this just feeling like filmed theatre. The camera captures the room, sticks close to characters, moves around, in and out accordingly and it never feels stiff. This aids the sense of tension from the audience point of view as we are not just left watching the room so much as being in it. The ensemble cast are another big factor in this delivery as they all deliver. On the surface of it the characters could easily be labelled ""racist"", ""old"", ""naïve"", ""angry"" and so on but the actors don't let themselves be that basic and they also do a good job of pacing the building resentment and tension in the room to be convincing. Fonda maybe has ""top-billing"" but he does have the least showy role, leading those into his corner. Cobb and Begley have good turns as the anger of the room but everyone plays their parts very well. OK Balsam, Webber and Voskovec come out the least memorable of the lot but this is understandable when viewed beside such sterling turns from Fielder, Klugman, Warden, Sweeney and Marshall. There really isn't a weak link in the room.

With modern cynical eyes it is perhaps totally hard to accept the film for its praise of the jury system and I do agree with the ""MYMS"" group when they made reference to the moment in H:LOTS which is essentially the bitter reverse of this film. However this slightly flag-waving stuff is covered by the delivery being as strong and as well paced as it is. Overall then this is an eminently watchable film and I can understand why it is so well regarded. The material and message may not be note-perfect but the delivery is brilliant across the board and it is one that I could easily return to again and again and still get pleasure out of how well it is all done.",a young ethnic kid rough area murder charg juri twelv men seem fairli open shut case so surpris vote come back one guilti pack juror maintain hold reason doubt much frustrat rest group the stalem forc debat detail case see man question other motiv decis the heat room passag time see tension rise minut im massiv fan movi you must see podcast crew mostli tend discus event film rather realli critiqu review although time mate pub approach ok anyway one advantag anyon point film see remind film so i listen angri men realis i never review i actual watch mani year of cours mental i knew classic i realli understand so came televis recent i watch new eye the film move right juri room pretti much room durat initi script realli well viewer side major discus evid seem clear cut doubt seem gener nonspecif thi good way start mean viewer also question taken along journey like men juri gradual get detail doubt tweak point solv crime done way interest engag it perfect regard though jump big assumpt stretch knowledg room littl conveni howev weak materi cover fact deliveri roundli quit brilliant lumet direct within room make great use small space it feel like could play sure lumet prevent feel like film theatr the camera captur room stick close charact move around accordingli never feel stiff thi aid sen tension audienc point view left watch room much the ensembl cast anoth big factor deliveri deliv on surfac charact could easili label racist old naïv angri actor dont let basic also good job pace build resent tension room convinc fonda mayb topbil least showi role lead corner cobb begley good turn anger room everyon play part well ok balsam webber voskovec come least memor lot understand view besid sterl turn fielder klugman warden sweeney marshal there realli isnt weak link room with modern cynic eye perhap total hard accept film prais juri system i agre mym group made refer moment hlot essenti bitter revers film howev slightli flagwav stuff cover deliveri strong well pace overal emin watchabl film i understand well regard the materi messag may noteperfect deliveri brilliant across board one i could easili return still get pleasur well done,Positive

"... the main flaw being that everybody brings their own life experiences and history into the jury room with them, no matter how hard they try to be impartial.

Here you have a trial of a young boy who supposedly stabbed his father to death. When the jurors go back to deliberate on the case, ALL but one lone man played with a quiet courage by Henry Fonda states guilty and the rest of the film is about trying to get them to his side. Quite an amazing movie if you ask me. Fonda's case is not that the boy is innocent, but that the threshold of reasonable doubt has not been reached. The trick in this film is that it never leaves the jury room. You have no idea of what the defendant, the prosecuting attorney, or the defense attorney were like other than retroactively through the words of the jurors.

Writing this good just can't be ignored. Reginald Rose's screenplay is absolutely brilliant. Not only are the characters of twelve individuals indelibly implanted in your brain within the limited time span of about 100 minutes, but Rose accomplishes this feat without undue speechifying or pontificating about injustice or the failures of the jury system or expositional dialogue. The characters personalities come out in the course of the film and are not ""set up"" in the first half hour, (as in having the jurors explain to each other what their occupations and backgrounds are) as is the case with mediocre screenplays. As for the acting it is true ensemble greatness. All twelve cast members are excellent, although if you put a gun to my head and forced me to say who was best I'd express a partiality for Lee J Cobb as the toughest nut to crack for acquittal and E. G. Marshall as a juror who is all logic and no emotion other than arrogance. And Sidney Lumet's first film just may be his most fast paced. The hundred minutes whiz by! Not a dull stretch to be seen anywhere.

And yes, these are twelve white men judging a Puerto Rican boy, and yes Henry Fonda violated many classic rules of jury behavior when he introduced items into the discussion that were not official evidence, but this was 60 years ago and it IS a movie. So just suspend your beliefs and try to enjoy the art of the thing -the riveting dialogue, the character studies that don't choke each other out, and the brilliant camera-work that manages to make the room seem increasingly smaller so that you can appreciate the claustrophobia that must be setting in with the jurors as deliberations wear on and get more heated.",main flaw everybodi bring life experi histori juri room matter hard tri imparti here trial young boy supposedli stab father death when juror go back deliber case all one lone man play quiet courag henri fonda state guilti rest film tri get side quit amaz movi ask fonda case boy innoc threshold reason doubt reach the trick film never leav juri room you idea defend prosecut attorney defens attorney like retroact word juror write good cant ignor reginald rose screenplay absolut brilliant not charact twelv individu indel implant brain within limit time span minut rose accomplish feat without undu speechifi pontif injustic failur juri system exposit dialogu the charact person come cours film set first half hour juror explain occup background case mediocr screenplay a act true ensembl great all twelv cast member excel although put gun head forc say best id express partial lee j cobb toughest nut crack acquitt e g marshal juror logic emot arrog and sidney lumet first film may fast pace the hundr minut whiz not dull stretch seen anywher and ye twelv white men judg puerto rican boy ye henri fonda violat mani classic rule juri behavior introduc item discus offici evid year ago is movi so suspend belief tri enjoy art thing rivet dialogu charact studi dont choke brilliant camerawork manag make room seem increasingli smaller appreci claustrophobia must set juror deliber wear get heat,Positive

"So simple yet so brilliant, 12 ANGRY MEN is not to be missed. It's the tale of the meticulous Mr. Davis, a juror not quite convinced of a murder suspect's guilt despite what appears to be overwhelming evidence. His questions gradually persuade his fellow jurors that things aren't always as open-and-shut as they might seem.

One of the great all-time ensemble casts highlights 12 ANGRY MEN. Henry Fonda is superb as the hardcore skeptic... but then again, everyone is superb, from Joseph Sweeney as the eldest juror to E.G. Marshall as the no-nonsense Juror #4. Anytime a film set almost exclusively at a single cramped table in a single cramped room can spellbound the viewer, you know you've got first-rate actors. The clever, colorful dialog is a treat as well.

Yet the strongest asset of 12 ANGRY MEN is the demands it makes of the viewer to think critically. Initially we are like most of the jurors, curious as to how Fonda can be so naive to think the young suspect may be innocent. But he gradually pulls us into his line of reasoning, challenging our assumptions and finding fault with the supposed facts. By the film's end, we're left wondering how we could have been so narrow-minded just 90 minutes earlier.

As sharp as what's on screen is, 12 ANGRY MEN is equally smart for what it does not show. Many of today's filmgoers would demand flashback sequences to depict what the characters describe. They would want to get to know the accused killer so they could judge him for themselves. They would want more action, more pizazz, and changes of scenery. Yet it's precisely the film's refusal to do any of this that makes it work so well. The viewer is effectively the 13th juror with nothing but recollections of testimony to go on. Our imaginations are free to create a picture of the alleged murder, just as we would have to as part of the jury.

12 ANGRY MEN is often cited as one of the greatest films ever. It's a verdict that is well deserved.",so simpl yet brilliant angri men miss it tale meticul mr davi juror quit convinc murder suspect guilt despit appear overwhelm evid hi question gradual persuad fellow juror thing arent alway openandshut might seem one great alltim ensembl cast highlight angri men henri fonda superb hardcor skeptic everyon superb joseph sweeney eldest juror eg marshal nononsens juror anytim film set almost exclus singl cramp tabl singl cramp room spellbound viewer know youv got firstrat actor the clever color dialog treat well yet strongest asset angri men demand make viewer think critic initi like juror curiou fonda naiv think young suspect may innoc but gradual pull u line reason challeng assumpt find fault suppos fact by film end left wonder could narrowmind minut earlier a sharp what screen angri men equal smart show mani today filmgoer would demand flashback sequenc depict charact describ they would want get know accus killer could judg they would want action pizazz chang sceneri yet precis film refus make work well the viewer effect th juror noth recollect testimoni go our imagin free creat pictur alleg murder would part juri angri men often cite one greatest film ever it verdict well deserv,Positive

The fact that the film has been shot in one room blew my mind away, seems very easy to direct huh? But with a superb script and acting Sidney Lumet created one of the greatest films ever made if not the greatest.

The dialogue is realistic and so sharp with a brilliant acting from Henry Fonda and Lee J.Cobb, I feel this film is still underrated even in IMDb rankings.

"Twelve jurors deliberate the case of an 18-year-old impoverished youth accused of stabbing his father to death. While 11 Jurors are immediately in favor of a ""guilty"" verdict with Juror #3 (Lee J. Cobb) the loudest supporter, one juror, Juror #8 (Henry Fonda), stands as the lone ""Not Guilty"" verdict and feels they should discuss the case rather than immediately render a verdict. As deliberations commence in the sweltering jury room during a heat wave positions and assumptions are challenged as jurors find their pre-conceived notions and personal prejudices challenged by new lights shone on the facts, witnesses and evidence.

12 Angry Men is an adaptation of the 1954 television play Twelve Angry Men written by Reginald Rose for anthology series Studio One. The success of the teleplay resulted in stage adaptations, which in turn lead to a theatrical adaptation in 1957 produced by Henry Fonda. The movie also became the directorial debut of Sidney Lumet who had done TV work for both Studio One and The Alcoa Hour. While the movie received critical acclaim including Academy Award nominations for Best Picture, Best Director, and Best Adapted Screenplay, the movie was a box office disappointment in the US (but did better internationally) due to the advent of color and widescreen productions and it wouldn't be until television airings the film would find an audience. 12 Angry Men has ingrained itself in pop culture with all manner of references, allusions, and parodies of the work still being made to this day as well as re-adaptations both domestically and abroad. Rightly so, because while 12 Angry Men's premise is very simple, it's filled with all manner of complex characters we get to know over the course of its 90 minute runtime.

The movie is essentially a chamber piece. Aside from scenes at the opening and closing of the movie, once we're in that jury room with our collection of actors featuring E. G. Marshall, Martin Baslam, and John Fiedler just to name a few we don't leave and the actors all give weight and presence to their characters so we feel like we get to know their personalities and histories and they play well off each other as tensions escalate. The movie takes a detached view of the murder case with most of the elements conveyed to us from second hand recounts of eyewitness statements leaving the audience very much in the position of determining whether or not the accused is in fact guilty with the same unreliable evidence.

12 Angry Men remains a solid chamber drama with great performances from its ensemble and timeless themes. Henry Fonda gives a great performance, but it wouldn't stand out as much without the great assortment of other actors he plays off of. It's a classic for a reason.",twelv juror deliber case yearold impoverish youth accus stab father death while juror immedi favor guilti verdict juror lee j cobb loudest support one juror juror henri fonda stand lone not guilti verdict feel discus case rather immedi render verdict a deliber commenc swelter juri room heat wave posit assumpt challeng juror find preconceiv notion person prejudic challeng new light shone fact wit evid angri men adapt televis play twelv angri men written reginald rose antholog seri studio one the success teleplay result stage adapt turn lead theatric adapt produc henri fonda the movi also becam directori debut sidney lumet done tv work studio one the alcoa hour while movi receiv critic acclaim includ academi award nomin best pictur best director best adapt screenplay movi box offic disappoint u better intern due advent color widescreen product wouldnt televis air film would find audienc angri men ingrain pop cultur manner refer allus parodi work still made day well readapt domest abroad rightli angri men premis simpl fill manner complex charact get know cours minut runtim the movi essenti chamber piec asid scene open close movi juri room collect actor featur e g marshal martin baslam john fiedler name dont leav actor give weight presenc charact feel like get know person histori play well tension escal the movi take detach view murder case element convey u second hand recount eyewit statement leav audienc much posit determin whether accus fact guilti unreli evid angri men remain solid chamber drama great perform ensembl timeless theme henri fonda give great perform wouldnt stand much without great assort actor play it classic reason,Positive

"When I found this movie in the ""Top 250"" in such a high position, i was quite surprised, especially when I realized that 90% of the movie happens in a room, and that's a risk, Because you need the characters to be quite flashy and that the script that is delivered has to be very entertaining not to be bored, and it goes that this movie does not bore you, it keeps you intrigued by the case that is, the juries are very Outstanding, I will not do a long review, it is only a recommendation of a person who doubted much of a movie of this style and was fascinated.

(It is also an important fact to say that I am not a man very interested in crime issues, nor very knowledgeable about it.)

The film deals with the case of a young man who is being blamed for murder and the jury must decide whether to give the maximum penalty or not. It is a plot that looks pretty simple, noting that this movie is based on a play from what I understand. What I called a lot of the movie is the atmosphere that you are given in the room, a hot day, 12 tired men and some of them want to leave as quickly as caring the sentence really. This film I liked also because it deals with quite interesting subjects: doubt, as our experience affects us in our decisions, go, subjects that look in perspective rather boring (Thinking of someone who only wants to watch a movie and not a moral debate) but that Are developed so well and subtly that you do not feel that you are giving a speech, you feel that you are watching a movie with interesting themes.

"Twelve Angry Men was a very good movie, with good dialogue and an excellent cast. The cast had a lot of opposite personalities which made the dynamics on the movie very interesting to watch. Although the audio was not as good as present day films and the dialogue was occasionally slow, the tension and interplay of the jurors quickly picked up again and kept your interest in the movie. It was amazing how one by one Henry Ford's character was able to convert all the other jurors over to a non-guilty verdict. It was really scary how all of the other 11 jurors wanted to vote guilty just to get the trial over with because they didn't want to be stuck at the courthouse. They all had better things to do, like go to a baseball game or visit with the friends and they didn't want to look to closely at the accuracy of the testimony, but Henry Ford's character made them take the time to think it through. Watching the movie Twelve Angry Men was much better than reading the written play because you could really see all the characters more clearly. The emotions, the tension and the frustration was so much more obvious in the film and came across so much more strongly than it did in written form.

"A lot has already been said about this masterpiece, thus it seems almost unnecessary to praise its many qualities. There two elements in particular, though, which set it apart from other classics.

One is how it showcases the sheer power of good screenplay and acting. There's no need for special effects, stunning cinematography or forced plot twists to create an intelligent and extremely entertaining film. Director Sidney Lumet only needed one room, twelve good actors and a timeless issue. With twelve distinctive characters, there are endless possibilities for interaction between them: what would happen if an extremely rigorous man had to cooperate with someone who'd rather play tic-tac-toe? Or an old man who finds himself ignored by many with a young businessman who costantly talks about his job?

The second aspect is how, despite being more than sixty years old, this movie's characters are incredibly relatable. Everyone has their biases, some are more emotional, some calmer, some more rigorous, some more chaotic. It is safe to say that we all now at least someone who resembles each of the twelve angry men. What is extraordinary is that this incredibly poignant characterisation is achieved with little more than an hour and a half for twelve distinct jurors, and all of them are memorable.

"The unsurpassed character studies of the ""12 Angry Men"" would almost make a movie worth seeing even if it had little else to offer. This is also a very good drama that uses everything it has to good advantage. The cast and director Sidney Lumet all do a fine job of sketching each character efficiently and memorably. Every character is important, and almost every line serves a purpose.

One interesting thing about the story is that the trial per se is almost not even particularly important. The jury setting is really just a stylized way of high-lighting many aspects of human nature and human interaction, and in particular, the varied ways that different persons respond in situations where their options are limited. The characters have a wide and well-chosen diversity of personalities and opinions, and each one's temperament and attitudes are developed as things proceed.

In performing this kind of material, it's important for the actors not to overdo it, or else the believability suffers. It's also a challenge to keep things interesting when the settings and props are so limited. But everything works very well here, and it is a credit to everyone involved.",the unsurpass charact studi angri men would almost make movi worth see even littl el offer thi also good drama use everyth good advantag the cast director sidney lumet fine job sketch charact effici memor everi charact import almost everi line serv purpos one interest thing stori trial per se almost even particularli import the juri set realli styliz way highlight mani aspect human natur human interact particular vari way differ person respond situat option limit the charact wide wellchosen diver person opinion one tempera attitud develop thing proceed in perform kind materi import actor overdo el believ suffer it also challeng keep thing interest set prop limit but everyth work well credit everyon involv,Positive
"I personally think the movie Twelve Angry Men is better then the play. Not just for the reasons that I like retro movies or that the acting was so bad it was kind-of funny. But for the fact that the movies plot connected to me in a way I don't think it connected with other people. Because I have a thing for law and I think that this plot and this movie/play showed me a different side of law that isn't really talked about, but is a big part of the process. The reason I picked the movie over the play was that I guess my era is used and is attracted to movies more then to reading also that it was funny that the whole movie was 90 minutes of twelve men sitting in one room which got really boring but not as boring as the play. This might not be the best. Another reason I don't like the play as much as the movie is that. I don't think everyone was interested as I was and didn't really follow along and when it came to their part to read I was ready and they weren't ready to read which was really boring. Because yo9u would have to wait for them and I think I fell asleep a couple times. But overall the movie was WAY better then the play. If you're into law I think it's a must see.

"12 Angry Men (1957) is a movie I recently watched for the first time in a long time on Tubi. The storyline follows a jury trying a case for murder where everyone agrees but one person. That one person discusses the case with the jury and explains why he doesn't agree based on the evidence. Will the jurors change their mind and align with the man or will it be a hung jury?

This movie is directed by Sidney Lumet (Before the Devil Know You're Dead) and stars Henry Fonda (The Wrong Man), Lee J. Cobb (On the Waterfront), Jack Warden (Heaven Can Wait), Edward Binns (Patton), Martin Balsam (Psycho) and E. G. Marshall (Creepshow).

The storyline for this picture is very smart and unique. The acting and dialogue is out of this world and the storyline is well paced and unfolds well. The acting is splendid and Fonda and Cobb's back and forth is very good. There are many unpredictable elements. Some of the sequences felt unrealistic; but overall, it was still an entertaining watch.

This movie isn't perfect but it is definitely worth a viewing.

"At risk of repeating myself a few words in, let's not bury the lede: '12 angry men' is one of the greatest movies that will ever be made.

This film's reputation far precedes it, and it's taken me far too long to actually get around to watching it. It has far exceeded all possible expectations. The premise is so simple, and the plot is no more than a tracing of the jury's discussion, but those bare-bones elements are all that is necessary to produce a stunning, moving picture. Quintessential, paramount themes include and are not limited to prejudice and confirmation bias; redirected anger, ego, and inflated notions of masculinity; careful deliberation and critical thinking; reason, mob rule, and the former prevailing over the latter; loud mouths, empty heads, and hot tempers; presumption of innocence, the dire importance of ""doubt,"" due process, democracy, justice - and still more. It's a picture that is at times infuriating, sad, inspiring, or thought-provoking, and lively and stimulating at all points, while nonetheless spending 97% of its length within a single room. For all the rightly acclaimed features that have ever been made, precious few immediately make so staggering and lasting an impact as this. '12 angry men' is truly perfect.

The dialogue and scene writing in Reginald Rose's screenplay is ""everything,"" as the youths say. Even within a singular space these manage to be rich, vibrant, and dynamic, carrying a dazzling array of ideas, moods, and flavors. Though of a completely different genre, only one other picture (Tilman Singer's 2018 indie horror flick 'Luz') readily comes to mind as having achieved anything like the same effect of communicating a cohesive, whole narrative without actively filming that which is being described. It's the screenwriting equivalent of an ice cream cone that simultaneously embodies one's every favorite flavor, even those that ordinarily conflict and weren't scooped. The progression of the jurors' heated conversation is a stroke of brilliance, twisting and shifting with fiery passion and steadfast willfulness that roundly impresses. Just as notable is that '12 angry men' declines additional amplifying embellishments (e.g. A reveal that a juror is on the take) as we would expect of most courtroom dramas: this is the story of twelve men honoring their ""civil responsibility,"" and nothing more. And that is most assuredly all it needs to be.

Rose's characters represent a noteworthy (if entirely white and male) diversity of backgrounds, values, beliefs, and preconceptions. One could only imagine the fireworks that may ensue from a 21st century remake that reflects genuine, realistic diversity, but still this 50s rendition is enough without it. There is depth and complexity to each of the jurors that is wonderfully gratifying as a viewer - and the cast is utterly extraordinary in breathing life into them all. With character comportment ranging from calm and collected, to brash and volatile, and everything in between, every actor on hand is given stupendous opportunity to illustrate their skill, and they definitely do. Each individual performance is just magnificent as anything else in '12 angry men,' and marked with exquisite range, nuance, strength and force of personality, and physicality that turns one sweltering room into a blast furnace of deeply absorbing drama. I could name the actors one by one, but it's just as easy to scroll through the cast list - from one to the next, they are tremendous.

It would be very easy to speak at greater length about the resounding triumph of cinema '12 angry men' is, but there would come a point where one only talking in circles. Suffice to say that it's near-universal acclaim and high regard is absolutely deserved; I feel like a fool for having taken so long to ever watch it, and for the mere thought that it wouldn't hold up. Sixty-five years later this remains a masterful drama that demands to be seen wherever you may have the opportunity.",at risk repeat word let buri lede angri men one greatest movi ever made thi film reput far preced taken far long actual get around watch it far exceed possibl expect the premis simpl plot trace juri discus barebon element necessari produc stun move pictur quintessenti paramount theme includ limit prejudic confirm bia redirect anger ego inflat notion masculin care deliber critic think reason mob rule former prevail latter loud mouth empti head hot temper presumpt innoc dire import doubt due process democraci justic still it pictur time infuri sad inspir thoughtprovok live stimul point nonetheless spend length within singl room for rightli acclaim featur ever made preciou immedi make stagger last impact angri men truli perfect the dialogu scene write reginald rose screenplay everyth youth say even within singular space manag rich vibrant dynam carri dazzl array idea mood flavor though complet differ genr one pictur tilman singer indi horror flick luz readili come mind achiev anyth like effect commun cohes whole narr without activ film describ it screenwrit equival ice cream cone simultan embodi one everi favorit flavor even ordinarili conflict werent scoop the progress juror heat convers stroke brillianc twist shift fieri passion steadfast will roundli impress just notabl angri men declin addit amplifi embellish eg a reveal juror take would expect courtroom drama stori twelv men honor civil respons noth and assuredli need rose charact repres noteworthi entir white male diver background valu belief preconcept one could imagin firework may ensu st centuri remak reflect genuin realist diver still rendit enough without there depth complex juror wonder gratifi viewer cast utterli extraordinari breath life with charact comport rang calm collect brash volatil everyth everi actor hand given stupend opportun illustr skill definit each individu perform magnific anyth el angri men mark exquisit rang nuanc strength forc person physic turn one swelter room blast furnac deepli absorb drama i could name actor one one easi scroll cast list one next tremend it would easi speak greater length resound triumph cinema angri men would come point one talk circl suffic say nearunivers acclaim high regard absolut deserv i feel like fool taken long ever watch mere thought wouldnt hold sixtyf year later remain master drama demand seen wherev may opportun,Positive

"12 Angry Men is a 1957 American drama film with elements of film noir, adapted from a teleplay of the same name by Reginald Rose. Written and co-produced by Rose himself and directed by Sidney Lumet, this trial film tells the story of a jury made up of 12 men as they deliberate the guilt or acquittal of a defendant on the basis of reasonable doubt. In the United States, a verdict in most criminal trials by jury must be unanimous. The film is notable for its almost exclusive use of one set: with the exception of the film's opening, which begins outside on the steps of the courthouse followed by the judge's final instructions to the jury before retiring, two short scenes in an adjoining washroom, and a brief final scene on the courthouse steps, the entire film takes place in the jury room. The total time spent outside the jury room is three minutes out of the full 96 minutes of the film.

12 Angry Men explores many techniques of consensus-building, and the difficulties encountered in the process, among a group of men whose range of personalities adds intensity and conflict. No names are used in the film: the jury members are identified by number until two of them exchange names at the very end, the defendant is referred to as ""the boy"", and the witnesses as ""the old man"" and ""the lady across the street"".

In 2007, 12 Angry Men was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being ""culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant"" and is often seen as one of the greatest films ever made.",angri men american drama film element film noir adapt teleplay name reginald rose written coproduc rose direct sidney lumet trial film tell stori juri made men deliber guilt acquitt defend basi reason doubt in unit state verdict crimin trial juri must unanim the film notabl almost exclus use one set except film open begin outsid step courthous follow judg final instruct juri retir two short scene adjoin washroom brief final scene courthous step entir film take place juri room the total time spent outsid juri room three minut full minut film angri men explor mani techniqu consensusbuild difficulti encount process among group men whose rang person add intens conflict no name use film juri member identifi number two exchang name end defend refer boy wit old man ladi across street in angri men select preserv unit state nation film registri librari congress cultur histor aesthet signific often seen one greatest film ever made,Neutral

"The first time I discovered IMDB's top 250 list, I noticed that ""12 Angry Men"" was the 5th best movie ever. I had heard of the film but only the version starring Jack Lemmon from 1997. After some research, I realized this film has one of the strongest casts of any movie ever released. Its cast has much success outside of this film. Out of the 12 jurors, five nominations for Oscars, three won Oscars, seven received an Emmy nomination, and six received a Golden Globe nomination. Henry Fonda, who is the film's lead actor, is one of my favorites of all time. His film ""On Golden Pond"" is a film that I view as perfection. Fond's performance in this film is one of the finest of his career.

This film also is directed by Sidney Lumet, who made another favorite movie of mine ""Murder on the Orient Express."" This film is one of those films that is pretty much perfect. I don't love it as much as ""Murder on the Orient Express,"" but I love it more than any other courtroom drama. It's better than my other two favorite courtroom dramas, ""My Cousin Vinny"" and ""The People vs. Larry Flynt."" I think it's much better than the highly overrated ""To Kil a Mockingbird."" I don't see what people see in that film. I think it's a six.

In Conclusion. This film is not the best Henry Fonda film (On Golden Pond). This film is not the best Sidney Lumet film (Murder on the Orient Express). It's not even the best Martin Balsam (Juror #1) film (Psycho). But it's one of my favorite films, Easily a 10/10.",the first time i discov imdb top list i notic angri men th best movi ever i heard film version star jack lemmon after research i realiz film one strongest cast movi ever releas it cast much success outsid film out juror five nomin oscar three oscar seven receiv emmi nomin six receiv golden globe nomin henri fonda film lead actor one favorit time hi film on golden pond film i view perfect fond perform film one finest career thi film also direct sidney lumet made anoth favorit movi mine murder orient express thi film one film pretti much perfect i dont love much murder orient express i love courtroom drama it better two favorit courtroom drama my cousin vinni the peopl v larri flynt i think much better highli overr to kil mockingbird i dont see peopl see film i think six in conclus thi film best henri fonda film on golden pond thi film best sidney lumet film murder orient express it even best martin balsam juror film psycho but one favorit film easili,Positive
"I hope that people don't see the score without reading the reviews as much as I think they do. Believe me, I find that you can still enjoy a movie, even respect it, without liking it. This is definitely the case with 12 Angry men. While I can enjoy the experience of watching the film, I've come to the rather unpopular opinion that this is not a great film. 12 Angry men works far better as a stage play, than a movie. As a film, it's quit uninspired and lacking emotion. The dialogue being as uninteresting as your least favorite math class, this is only accentuated by the fact that this film attempts to carry itself on dialogue and performance. Another problem comes right from the name itself; 12. The 12 angry men in the film are mostly indiscernible from each other, excluding a select few. While on stage the characters can show a lot of complexity with each actor playing off of each others emotions and bringing something new to performances each night, the film is lacking in character development.",i hope peopl dont see score without read review much i think believ i find still enjoy movi even respect without like thi definit case angri men while i enjoy experi watch film ive come rather unpopular opinion great film angri men work far better stage play movi a film quit uninspir lack emot the dialogu uninterest least favorit math class accentu fact film attempt carri dialogu perform anoth problem come right name the angri men film mostli indiscern exclud select while stage charact show lot complex actor play other emot bring someth new perform night film lack charact develop,Positive
"There's not much that can be said about 12 Angry Men apart from it being a very well made movie. It is ture that its plot is nothing special and it seems very boring at first but as you get deeper and deeper you start to enjoy it. Because the thing that makes this movie good is not some awesome and unique plot but the impressive dialogues. I actually think that this movie is a bit overrated but I have to admit that it has one of the best dialogues. These marvelous dialogues are the thing that makes this movie the masterpiece it is.

The acting is on an average level. The actors did a good job but I can't say that anyone of them did an outstanding performance. As for the cinematography it could've been better. I personally think that if they had shot this movie form different angles it would've looked more intriguing and intense. But still as I already said 12 Angry Men has a very well written script and that's enough for it to be called a good movie.",there much said angri men apart well made movi it ture plot noth special seem bore first get deeper deeper start enjoy becaus thing make movi good awesom uniqu plot impress dialogu i actual think movi bit overr i admit one best dialogu these marvel dialogu thing make movi masterpiec the act averag level the actor good job i cant say anyon outstand perform a cinematographi couldv better i person think shot movi form differ angl wouldv look intrigu intens but still i alreadi said angri men well written script that enough call good movi,Positive
"This is best movie for me. I love this movie. The film explores themes such as justice and the complexities of the system of judging a person. The film takes place in only one room and has no other locations than the trial at the beginning and it is really striking. Not all films manage to show the story in one room so well.

"Juror #1, the foreman (Martin Balsam, football coach): ""Well, I won't be too technical, or make a long speech  it's just that it's a one-set film, so it's new and risky, because you know, dialogs are not enough, we need uh  the thrills  and it goes slowly in the beginning but progressively, it's like the jury room becomes smaller, and the faces bigger. I really felt the tense and suffocating atmosphere ... And what an explosive climax, I could hardly breathe  I know it's strange, but the direction, well, the movie is one hell of a thriller  I, well, my verdict is clear: GREAT MOVIE""

Juror #2 (John Fiedler, bank clerk): ""I don't know. It's an excellent film, served by great performances. Every character was convincing, so were their interactions. I can't find any flaw, for me, there's nothing to add, and nothing to remove. It is a GREAT MOVIE""

Juror #3 (Lee J. Cobb, businessman): ""I told you why this movie is great, it's just  thought provoking, everything and I mean everything looked like it would have been this kind of preachy film with a good-hearted hero and simple-minded antagonists who just want to be vindictive. But this is an intelligent film which, even at the end, makes you question if the kid is guilty or not. Because it has nothing to do with punishment, it's about justice ... without any prejudice, and that deserves respect, yes sir! No doubt for me  GREAT MOVIE""

Juror #4 (E.G. Marshall, stockbroker): ""First of all, it's an excellent examination of all the subtle nuances that enrich a male adult demography, played with such believability every one could identify with one of the jurors. Secondly, the writing was intellectually gripping and emotionally engaging and I would add: respectful of the viewer's intelligence. The direction was excellent and created a feeling of growing claustrophobia guided by a very clever use of focal lenses, a credit to Sidney Lumet. Last but not least, it's about the noble concept of justice and presumption of innocence: ""12 Angry Men"" delivers a brilliant, intelligent, and universally inspiring message. To conclude, I can say I had the privilege to watch a GREAT MOVIE""

Juror #5 (Jack Klugman, the man from the slum): ""What else to say? I second the idea that it's a powerful drama demonstrating how prejudices poison the heart of our civilization, and I believe this is one of the few films that should be screened everywhere in the world as a powerful lesson for tolerance. My verdict is: GREAT MOVIE""

Juror #6 (Edward Binns, painter): ""A movie that younger and future generations should watch and respect. These are movies with no special effects, no big-star cast, no big explosions, no flashy cars and no sexy girls. You have a honest, simple movie featuring ordinary men, but the result is so impacting it should be appreciated by any movie lover, regardless of his or her age. Anyway, GREAT MOVIE""

Juror #7 (Jack Warden, salesman): ""Come on, everyone is using big words and noble concepts, but for me, this movie is just damn entertaining. Hey admit it, the dialogs, the way opposite characters interact, create a lot of anxiety but is also very fun to watch, sometimes, well  I think you can say anything, but without entertainment, a film is worthless, and the movie could've been a bore, just all talk and no walk, but it wasn't, it worked for me ... GREAT MOVIE""

Juror #8 (Henry Fonda, architect): ""This movie invites us to explore our convictions and question the way they influence our judgments. Justice is done by men, blindly and implacably, this is why punishment must be beyond any doubt, and when you have what appears to be an open-and-shut case that progressively reveals some flaws as we go deeper in the subject, well, this says a lot about the negative impact of subjectivity when it comes to justice, and how we should be careful about the consequences of our thoughts, our words, our acts. ""12 Angry Men"" is a humanistic inspiration for those who have faith in justice. GREAT MOVIE""

Juror #9 (Joseph Sweeney, retired): ""This is a fantastic character study illustrating how convincingness is often driven by the personality. It's an incredible illustration of the way a few people can monopolize the talk and how a silent majority is eager to follow the ones who aggressively express their thoughts, and the courage it takes to be the lone dissenter and how using a constructive, polite and logical answer can destroy something taken for granted. While watching ""12 Angry Men"" I understood that a consensus, when rapidly built, means that the truth must be elsewhere. And one truth for sure, this is a GREAT MOVIE""

Juror #10 (Ed Begley, garage owner): ""I hate the patronizing way some left-wing good-hearted people adore this film, this has nothing to do with politics, truth or justice, it's about manipulation of your thoughts by pushing the right emotional button  you missed the point, and that's the beauty of the film, you're all easily fooled. Not for the reasons you think, but it's a GREAT MOVIE""

Juror #11 (Joseph Voskovek, watchmaker): ""No need to be American to appreciate the beauty of this film, it's about our deepest convictions. It's about the humanistic concept of reasonable doubt which can save even a guilty soul ... because life is valuable and justice is not vengeance. GREAT MOVIE""

Juror #12 (Robert Webber, advertising executive): ""Wow, what I can say, it's not an exact science you know  you can find a reason A to appreciate it, a reason B or C  let's just say that the 'sigma' of these reasons, explains why it's an incredible film and as my fellow jurors said, why ""12 Angry Men"" is a GREAT MOVIE""",juror foreman martin balsam footbal coach well i wont technic make long speech oneset film new riski know dialog enough need uh thrill goe slowli begin progress like juri room becom smaller face bigger i realli felt ten suffoc atmospher and explos climax i could hardli breath i know strang direct well movi one hell thriller i well verdict clear great movi juror john fiedler bank clerk i dont know it excel film serv great perform everi charact convinc interact i cant find flaw there noth add noth remov it great movi juror lee j cobb businessman i told movi great thought provok everyth i mean everyth look like would kind preachi film goodheart hero simplemind antagonist want vindict but intellig film even end make question kid guilti becaus noth punish justic without prejudic deserv respect ye sir no doubt great movi juror eg marshal stockbrok first excel examin subtl nuanc enrich male adult demographi play believ everi one could identifi one juror secondli write intellectu grip emot engag i would add respect viewer intellig the direct excel creat feel grow claustrophobia guid clever use focal lens credit sidney lumet last least nobl concept justic presumpt innoc angri men deliv brilliant intellig univers inspir messag to conclud i say i privileg watch great movi juror jack klugman man slum what el say i second idea power drama demonstr prejudic poison heart civil i believ one film screen everywher world power lesson toler my verdict great movi juror edward binn painter a movi younger futur gener watch respect these movi special effect bigstar cast big explos flashi car sexi girl you honest simpl movi featur ordinari men result impact appreci movi lover regardless age anyway great movi juror jack warden salesman come everyon use big word nobl concept movi damn entertain hey admit dialog way opposit charact interact creat lot anxieti also fun watch sometim well i think say anyth without entertain film worthless movi couldv bore talk walk wasnt work great movi juror henri fonda architect thi movi invit u explor convict question way influenc judgment justic done men blindli implac punish must beyond doubt appear openandshut case progress reveal flaw go deeper subject well say lot neg impact subject come justic care consequ thought word act angri men humanist inspir faith justic great movi juror joseph sweeney retir thi fantast charact studi illustr convincing often driven person it incred illustr way peopl monopol talk silent major eager follow one aggress express thought courag take lone dissent use construct polit logic answer destroy someth taken grant while watch angri men i understood consensu rapidli built mean truth must elsewher and one truth sure great movi juror ed begley garag owner i hate patron way leftw goodheart peopl ador film noth polit truth justic manipul thought push right emot button miss point that beauti film your easili fool not reason think great movi juror joseph voskovek watchmak no need american appreci beauti film deepest convict it humanist concept reason doubt save even guilti soul life valuabl justic vengeanc great movi juror robert webber advertis execut wow i say exact scienc know find reason a appreci reason b c let say sigma reason explain incred film fellow juror said angri men great movi,Positive
"A pure, simple, undeniable classic. This movie is a thoughtful, well shot, amazingly scripted, fantastically acted masterpiece. Even though the word masterpiece is often over-used (like genius) it certainly, and without dispute applies in this case. Sidney Lumet's directing is top-notch, and Henry Fonda is the still turning point of this small, microcosmic little world - his role has to be one of the most finely acted ever committed to film.

Set in an actual New York jury room, it's a claustrophobic, tightly confined set, where 12 very different men deliberate over the guilt of a young boy. Their prejudices, morals and personalities are thrown together and, sometimes violently, clash. Along with a great parallel commentary from the weather (at the beginning of the film, it's a stuffy, oppressive sweatbox, which becomes sidelined by a dark, stormy maelstrom outside the jury room) this is a fantastic film. You'd never think there were so many angles you could get from one single, uncomfortably confining room. Sidney Lumet's directing is amazing, as Fonda's chain-smkoing, softly spoken moralistic character could have been played so much darker; he manages to turn everyone around, slowly but surely, almost effortlessly converting even the most staunchly opposed and stoic juror - but he's not manipulative, sly or underhanded about it. He simply presents what is - he's the pure voice of reason, and he has some cracking lines. The other jurors are great, too. I'm sure we all know someone who fidgets through something important because they've got a football game starting in ten minutes - they all highlight broad generalisations of very human characters. I defy anyone not to find a character that illustrates someone they know in this motley crue.

"What a bloody stupid idea for a cinema film ! Adapt a teleplay set entirely in one studio bound location , written in real time with absolutely no cinema appeal whatsoever ! Me ? I wouldn`t have touched this script with a barge pole if I was a producer which just goes to show why - Only very very occasionally - some people deserve to be film producers while - Only very very occasionally - people like myself don`t . 12 ANGRY MEN is a masterpiece , maybe not in the way APOCALYPSE NOW or FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING are cinematic masterpieces , but it`s still a masterpiece of high drama

Despite being based on a play Lumet does bring some outstanding directorial flourishes to the film . Look at he scene where the camera cuts from one raised hand to another to an empty space that has a raised hand gingerly creeping into the frame , or the scene where the characters become more and more disgusted with Ed "" Know what I mean "" Begley`s reactionary diatribe . Please forgive Reginald Rose`s ever so slightly bleeding heart liberal subtext or a couple of unlikely occurances like the scene with the knife , or the fact that jury discussions are nothing like this in real life because even more thought went into this script as went into MEMENTO .

"You couldn't make make me sit through this one again!

Watching 12 stereotypes shaken together until the cream rises to the top is little better than watching water come to a boil. At first, the cold water is still and transparent, then tiny bubbles begin to form - yet the water is not even warm! It is the air coming out of solution! The bubbles grow larger and rise to the surface. Again, the water is clear, but movement can be detected. There are swirling convection currents forming. The water becomes hot. There is more and more movement, the surface of the water is clearly undulating, and the water is getting hotter. Bubbles again begin to form at the bottom of the pot. They expand and begin to rise, but collapse and disappear. The expansion and collapse of the water vapor creates noise and the pot begins to vibrate. Then traces of water vapor begin to rise from the rolling surface of the water. Finally, the bubbles of water vapor survive the journey to the surface and emerge - releasing steam to the air. How exciting!

Somehow, I just knew how everything would turn out - just like watching water boil, or shaking milk (I was around before homogenized milk).

I would recommend Andy Warhol's ""Empire"" to those who like this film. I won't give away the ending, but it's fairly predictable, and a bit longer than watching water boil.",you couldnt make make sit one watch stereotyp shaken togeth cream rise top littl better watch water come boil at first cold water still transpar tini bubbl begin form yet water even warm it air come solut the bubbl grow larger rise surfac again water clear movement detect there swirl convect current form the water becom hot there movement surfac water clearli undul water get hotter bubbl begin form bottom pot they expand begin rise collaps disappear the expans collaps water vapor creat nois pot begin vibrat then trace water vapor begin rise roll surfac water final bubbl water vapor surviv journey surfac emerg releas steam air how excit somehow i knew everyth would turn like watch water boil shake milk i around homogen milk i would recommend andi warhol empir like film i wont give away end fairli predict bit longer watch water boil,Neutral
"I saw this film for the first time a few months ago and i was automatically annoyed with myself for having not done so long before. To put short, this film is one of the best ever made and rightfully deserves its position on IMDBs top 250 list.

To be honest, there's not a lot that one can comment about the film. There are no special effects, dramatic monologues or defining scenes to discuss and really that's what makes this film the phenomenon that it is. It is quite easy to see where the film is going to go and how it is going to end early on but none of that really matters because excuse the sugary metaphor but it is the journey you embark on with the jurors, in particular Henry Fonda, that defines the film. The way in which each different aspect of the court case is re-evaluated is film heaven but also a hard hitter when reflecting on the seriousness that the film makes about judicial systems and the responsibility of juries to make thorough rational decisions.

If you had told me before the film that it was as near as makes no difference one scene with 12 men conversing for 100 minutes (or whatever), i would have kindly asked you if we could watch Die Hard instead, but oh what an ignorant error that would have been. 12 Angry Men is magnificent.",i saw film first time month ago automat annoy done long to put short film one best ever made right deserv posit imdb top list to honest there lot one comment film there special effect dramat monologu defin scene discus realli that make film phenomenon it quit easi see film go go go end earli none realli matter excus sugari metaphor journey embark juror particular henri fonda defin film the way differ aspect court case reevalu film heaven also hard hitter reflect serious film make judici system respons juri make thorough ration decis if told film near make differ one scene men convers minut whatev would kindli ask could watch die hard instead oh ignor error would angri men magnific,Positive
"In the days before cgi, massive hype, star-appeal, pseudo-mythic trilogies and all the other bumpf that hollywood tacks on to its product in order to make it sell, all it took to make a decent movie was to have a good script and cast, good direction and of course great acting.

These were (and still are) the only real ingredients which I'd say are essential for making a truly worthwhile movie.

"It's tough sometimes to translate a stage production- which 12 Angry Men essentially is- into a feature film, with in this case one cramped room and a dozen characters with totally varied ideals. In a way this is like the textbook example, however, of how to do a film like this. You see how the situation unfolds into something more, about the act of telling a story and finding all the pieces. That it has such a powerhouse of an ensemble doesn't hurt it at all, and the little surprises in how the casts acts and reacts works great on repeat viewings. The basic premise only needs brief mention, as the 12 men (totally angry may be disputed by some, though I'm sure not one is left without raising their voice), all white, are judging the case of a Hispanic charged with killing his father. The deliberation room becomes a kind of boiler room where Henry Fonda's juror #11, the only un-sure one, sets the stage for a something more to be revealed- human nature when on a judgment day, with all its intelligence, ignorance, hate, and seeking objectivism.

Sidney Lumet, on his very first feature-film, does a really professional (in a good way) job of directing the picture, by which a) letting the actors, who among the great lot include Lee J Cobb, John Fiedler, E.G. Marhall, Martin Balsam, Jack Klugman, Ed Begley, and in maybe the most under-rated role of the 'old man', Joseph Sweeney, just do their work and try to just make sure no one over-steps their ability in their strengths; b) using the atmosphere to high effect. Like he would later do with Network, Lumet uses the camera to add some level of subjectivity to the storytelling, being careful with choosing close-ups but using them very wisely (i.e. a surprise close-up on Sweeney), and here and there making it feel like the walls are just closing in a little more. But, at the same time, Lumet's making a studio picture, with the all-around good-guy Henry Fonda (in one of his best roles), and dealing with a story that's, when it comes down to it, just the details of a crime examined over. But the real strength of the film comes in a quality that it shares with Rashomon (different in structure to be sure), that the idea of looking for the truth is just a guise in a way to examine the people who are looking at what the truth is. It's a nifty movie that has deservedly stayed firm through the decades, not showing its age bad at all.",it tough sometim translat stage product angri men essenti featur film case one cramp room dozen charact total vari ideal in way like textbook exampl howev film like you see situat unfold someth act tell stori find piec that powerhous ensembl doesnt hurt littl surpris cast act react work great repeat view the basic premis need brief mention men total angri may disput though im sure one left without rais voic white judg case hispan charg kill father the deliber room becom kind boiler room henri fonda juror unsur one set stage someth reveal human natur judgment day intellig ignor hate seek objectiv sidney lumet first featurefilm realli profession good way job direct pictur let actor among great lot includ lee j cobb john fiedler eg marhal martin balsam jack klugman ed begley mayb underr role old man joseph sweeney work tri make sure one overstep abil strength b use atmospher high effect like would later network lumet use camera add level subject storytel care choos closeup use wise ie surpris closeup sweeney make feel like wall close littl but time lumet make studio pictur allaround goodguy henri fonda one best role deal stori that come detail crime examin but real strength film come qualiti share rashomon differ structur sure idea look truth gui way examin peopl look truth it nifti movi deservedli stay firm decad show age bad,Positive

"12 Angry Men is as simple as it is profound, and as bare-boned as it is a showcase of true camera-work and directional complexity. It is as much a film about the justice system in America as it is a film about people; a film that lets the viewer into a single room for 90 minutes (the film moves forward quicker than real time) and examines the quirks, insecurities, prejudices and glaring background differences of twelve different characters.

The film begins in a courtroom as a murder case is coming to a close. The judge informs the twelve jurors of their duty as though it were just another day in his life, as though the defendant (an 18-year old street kid) has already been proved guilty. In general, nobody in the film expects the potential (and probable) difficulties that the viewer anticipates externally. It is an ""open and shut case"" as the remarkable, unnamed juror (played by Lee J. Cobb) states in the first ten minutes.

Of course it isn't, otherwise 12 Angry Men would be an ""open-and-shut"" film. Opening credits play over an empty room which gradually fills up as the jurors takes their seats and prepare for the ballot. Over this time, we see windows being opened, negotiations taking place and pleasantries exchanged. If these 12 men agree that the c12 Angry Men (1957) by Sidney Lumet - Unsung Filmsase presents enough evidence to show that the crime had in fact been committed, then the verdict will be guilty. But if there is any room for what the judge calls ""reasonable doubt"", then the verdict changes.

Each character in this film is entirely different. It almost feels as though each has been handpicked to take part in a sort of experiment – and it very much feels like we are watching one unfold. Each man represents something unalike. With one man's decision not to conform, or at least not to believe everything that was discussed in the courtroom, 12 Angry Men erupts. Gradually, we start to understand these men; first, we are let it on some of their social backgrounds – one is an immigrant (possibly Greek or French) and one admits to have grown up in the same conditions as the young defendant. Both men should be able to relate to the defendant in many ways – for a moment, we are afforded a glimpse at the defendant's face, an immigrant from an anonymous ghetto. Strangely, both men vote ""guilty"" without hesitation.

12 Angry Men (1957) by Sidney Lumet - Unsung FilmsHenry Fonda lets us in on his reason for disputing — he simply does not want to decide on a person's life in the space of five minutes. This is understandable; the viewer takes his side and so, it seems, does the filmmaker. But some of the jurors argue as though it were personal; as though the young man had slaughtered their own sons, daughters and wives. Some of the men, and most noticeably Cobb as juror no. 3, work themselves up into a blind fury.

As the film goes on, it becomes evident that the case was never as clear as the jurors had announced at the beginning. For some, the more reasonable and likable characters, it had simply been a case of accepting the evidence provided without questions. For others, assumptions had been made as a result of deep-rooted prejudices and massive complexes. While many change their minds with the influence of rational thought, some characters simply get angrier and more aggressive; two characters give away their racist views and the powerful scene that runs over the final ten minutes, works to reveal so much about the most moving and brilliant character portrayal in the film.

The happenings described in court unfold for a second time over the duration of 12 Angry Men. By the end, it as though we possess the same knowledge of what happened in the courtroom over the days of the trial, as the twelve men in the film.

"An outstanding reenactment of writer Reginald Rose's superlative 1954 ""Studio One"" drama. Director Sidney Lumet shows how the boundaries in cinematic art can be stretched both ways; necessarily minimalist, he moves the actors and cameras in the jury room like a finely tuned ballet. Dependable Henry Fonda gives his best, and it's one of the most convincing ""Best Actor"" performances ever committed to celluloid. The supporting cast is perfect.

No matter how you feel about the film's thought-provoking thesis, you are captivated by juror Fonda's determination. When he introduces a switchblade into evidence - during deliberations! - like the pounding of a gavel, you know Fonda's intentions are premeditated; and, watching him unravel each juror's mind - along with your own - is truly stunning. Anyone interested in becoming a lawyer should consider Fonda a study model.

The defense rests.

"+++++ POSSIBLE SPOILERS +++++

""Twelve Angry Men"" is the perfect demonstration that when you have a good script, an intelligent director an a well selected cast a film doesn't have to be expensive or spectacular to be a real good one. This film is all about dialogues and acting and is set 95% in a small room yet its most entertaining and has a lot of tension.

When I said it had a well selected cast I didn't mean an all star cast; Henry Fonda was the only major star; Lee Cobb, Ed Begley, Martin Balsam and E.G. Marshall where very talented supporting actors but not stars; Jack Warden and Jack Klugman weren't even known much in films yet. But a simple direction by Sidney Lumet leaving the development to the script and actors performances worked well and the film is tense, intriguing and most entertaining from beginning to end.

""Twelve Angry Men"" is a ""trail film"" but with a very original focusing since by following the jury's debate the whole case is clearly revealed up to the verdict. It's also interesting that the verdict is not based in a not guilty conviction by the jurors but for the benefit of the doubt, which means that perhaps the boy actually killed his father.

One of the best movies I've ever seen in its genre.",possibl spoiler twelv angri men perfect demonstr good script intellig director well select cast film doesnt expens spectacular real good one thi film dialogu act set small room yet entertain lot tension when i said well select cast i didnt mean star cast henri fonda major star lee cobb ed begley martin balsam eg marshal talent support actor star jack warden jack klugman werent even known much film yet but simpl direct sidney lumet leav develop script actor perform work well film ten intrigu entertain begin end twelv angri men trail film origin focus sinc follow juri debat whole case clearli reveal verdict it also interest verdict base guilti convict juror benefit doubt mean perhap boy actual kill father one best movi ive ever seen genr,Positive

"Henry Fonda is the star here, but the other roles are filled by legendary character actors. To see Lee Cobb, Jack Klugman, Jack Warden, and Ed Begley all doing there thing at the same time is a joy. My main problem with the movie is that it is soooo preachy. The scene is painted in black and white, there are few shades of gray. Most of the character are stereotypes-- ie, the bigot, the bully, the nerd, the immigrant, the glad-handing but uncaring salesman, etc. It is a tribute to the fine actors that they bring such one-dimensional characters to life. And shining through it all is the oh so good man who has right, justice, and the American way on his side. The self-righteousness is a bit cloying, and I almost expect Fonda to have a halo over his head.

"Saw this first time when I was in 5th grade. Thot it was jus chatting n no action. Saw it again in 9th grade n found it to be totally engaging n character driven movie. Saw again in 2005 n then again few days back on a DVD. 12 Angry Men is a film that has aged incredibly well, offers fantastic performances, fantastic dialogues and a film that can be watched over and appreciated more and more each time. This movie shows in a marvelous simple way the mechanism of the justice system, how easily a man can be convicted to the death sentence based on prejudice, subjective declarations of witnesses and an unprofessional defense lawyer. Everything is good about this film. The screenplay by Reginald Rose (The wild geese, Escape from sobibor) is top notch. The direction by Lumet (Dog day aftnoon, Network, The verdict ) is excellent. It must be appallingly difficult to shoot an entire movie in such a small space, but Lumet does it superbly and the camera work is awesome. All the actors really got into the skin of the character n they portrayed their moods n emotions very well. Henry Fonda (The grapes of wrath, Once upon a time in the west, The longest day) n Lee J. Cobb (The exorcist, On the waterfront, Mackenna's gold) were awesome. So were the rest of the cast. It is a groundbreaking and timeless masterpiece of cinema, showing just how much can be achieved from a mundane premise. Well, so long.

"A dissenting juror (Henry Fonda) in a murder trial slowly manages to convince the others that the case is not as obviously clear as it seemed in court.

Today's audiences will find a young Jack Warden, perhaps now best known as Big Ben from ""Problem Child"", and Wisconsin-born John Fiedler, whose voice is recognizable as Piglet from ""Winnie the Pooh"". Along with Ed Begley and Henry Fonda, you already have a strong cast (and the other eight men are no slouches).

This film is timeless, both as a tribute to great actors of their generation, but also as a testament of the greatness of the American justice system. One likes to think this has inspired at least a few people to approach jury duty with the utmost seriousness and give the concept of ""reasonable doubt"" a run for its money.",a dissent juror henri fonda murder trial slowli manag convinc other case obvious clear seem court today audienc find young jack warden perhap best known big ben problem child wisconsinborn john fiedler whose voic recogniz piglet winni pooh along ed begley henri fonda alreadi strong cast eight men slouch thi film timeless tribut great actor gener also testament great american justic system one like think inspir least peopl approach juri duti utmost serious give concept reason doubt run money,Positive
"I defy anyone to watch this movie and not be completely absorbed in the group dynamics on display. I could take points off for the overly tidy and convenient script with its TV-movie ending or some of the less subtle methods through which director Sidney Lumet drives home his points. But with a cast as uniformly excellent as this, why quibble? Henry Fonda is just the person to play the liberal everyman, an extension of his Tom Joad character from ""The Grapes of Wrath."" E.G. Marshall is excellent as Fonda's most formidable opponent; cool-headed and logical, he's the only holdout who bases his verdict on facts instead of emotions. Lee J. Cobb's performance wears thin, and his character is the most poorly written. Ed Begley is almost too good in his role, so revolting is his character. Jack Klugman and Jack Warden register in smaller roles as well.

This movie conveys the sweaty, tension-filled atmosphere of a stifling jury room but never feels oppressive, thanks to Lumet's fluid direction. My favorite moment comes when Fonda begins counting off paces around the jury table (a key piece of evidence hinges on this), and the camera drops to floor level and follows his feet as he does so. Choices like this prevent Lumet's film from ever being static or stagy.

An important film and a great one. If you haven't already seen it, put it at the top of your list.

"Overall I loved this movie. It shows the group-dynamics of 12 people, the jury, trying to decide if there is ""reasonable doubt"" concerning whether a young boy killed his father. The discussions are tense and little by little we learn from these what supposedly happened on that night the kids father died. We are therefore also drawn into the question of whether the boy did it or not ourselves and what at first seems like a clear cut case along the way becomes all of a sudden much more complicated. It is a film that dares to handle nuances and ambiguities (we are never certain of whether the boy did it or not) in a way we rarely see. Its also a movie that lets us watch these 12 angry men discuss in the same room for a full 96 minutes without it ever getting boring, which I have to respect; you really have to thrust your material to let a whole movie consist of a discussion.

The movie also tries to show how personal issues can cloud the judgments of the jurors. I am thinking about one specific juror, and although the idea, of showing us how his own personal story interferes with sound judgment, is splendid, I frankly didn't like the way it unfolded in the movie. That's why I only give this movie 8/10.

If this movie in any way is supposed to represent how the legal system work I pray to god that I will never be put in a situation where a jury have to decide my guilt in any matter.

"One does not expect an ordinary black and white movie like ""Twelve Angry Men"" to set the foundation for great drama. Nevertheless, superior drama is what is delivered in this film. The setting is; a common courtroom in an eastern metropolitan city where twelve ordinary men have been selected to sit as a jury. The trial is over and the verbal testimony having been heard, the jury must now decide the fate of the young man on trial for his life. A common enough occurrence in America. But what is not common, is the mixed assortment of characters assembled for the jury. The real drama unfolds when a single juror (Henry Fonda) takes his task seriously and challenges each of his fellow members to think and then decide before they vote for the death penalty. When he does, the volatile reaction is nothing short of inspirational. One can only wish the same would happen to anyone facing a similar ordeal. The cast of characters is a vintage performance from all. Henry Fonda's performance is wonderful and courageous. He is joined by veterans actors, Martin Balsam, John Fiedler, Lee J. Cobb, E.G. Marshall, Jack Klugman, Ed Binns, Jack Warden, Joseph Sweeney, Ed Begley, George Voskovec and Robert Webber.

"I won't repeat the details of the plot as many comments above summarize the plot and even the 12 jurors in depth...

Briefly, Fonda's character challenges the rest of the 12 man jury to take time to reexamine the evidence before they send a very young man to the mandatory death sentence.

A fair challenge. Even tho the case (as one juror argues ) seem so ""open and shut"".

Here, the best thing about the film (to me) is the use of logic. Why? As the 12 men examine each bit of proof, they discover several possible logical flaws or false assumptions. Sound too dry? Not the way it is presented.

My criticism is that Fonda's character is just too perfect, too right and (for most of the movie) too free from perspiration, unlike the rest in that hot jury room.

Fonda early questions some jurors as to whether there's any possibility for error. If he said ""It's possible"" one more time, I was going to scream. (I remember various evil characters getting off on slim technicalities...! ) But fortunately, his questioning leads others to question evidence and to find REAL doubt that the testimony, etc. is valid.

Their use of logic to pick out the evidentiary flaws is fascinating. Thus, this is still an excellent movie worth watching!",i wont repeat detail plot mani comment summar plot even juror depth briefli fonda charact challeng rest man juri take time reexamin evid send young man mandatori death sentenc a fair challeng even tho case one juror argu seem open shut here best thing film use logic whi a men examin bit proof discov sever possibl logic flaw fals assumpt sound dri not way present my critic fonda charact perfect right movi free perspir unlik rest hot juri room fonda earli question juror whether there possibl error if said it possibl one time i go scream i rememb variou evil charact get slim technic but fortun question lead other question evid find real doubt testimoni etc valid their use logic pick evidentiari flaw fascin thu still excel movi worth watch,Positive
"12 Angry Men is a pretentious amateur ""detective"" story who's manipulative intent was easy to spot a mile away. As soon as they showed Henry Fonda's character of the The Architect (Juror # 8) I knew he was going to be the only one emotional enough to vote not guilty and with the help of very poor writing convince everyone else to do the same. Sure enough I was right.

Juror # 8 starts off just believing the 19-year old suspect was abused by his father for ""years"" with absolutely no evidence other than his bleeding heart and not simply disciplined for all the crimes he committed which included mugging, auto theft, robbery and knife fighting because as we know no one ever lies except of course all the eye witnesses in this trial and the detectives.

The Architect just makes one nonsense argument after another and every valid point brought up by the skeptics is just brushed aside until they finally change their mind for no logical reasoning whatsoever.

For instance, juror # 8 just manufacturers a time frame with no evidence to support it about how long it takes elevated train cars to pass by a single point. He does this based on his alleged past experience of living in an apartment near an elevated train line and everyone just buys it with no argument. This is embarrassingly bad for a number of reasons;

Since the film is set in New York City around 1956-57 we can find that during this time period there were 3 distinct elevated train car types (MUDC, Q-CARS and LO-V) from 7 different manufacturers (ACF, Cincinnati, IRT, Jewett, Pullman St. Louis, Wason) operating. It is just assumed in the film that every elevated train in NYC is made up of identical length, height and speed trains with the exact same window dimensions and placement when nothing could be farther from the truth.

What year did Juror # 8 have this apartment and what exact trains were running on the line at that time? Were those the same type's of train cars involved in this case? No answer is given. This is the equivalent of saying that you flew out of an airport years ago therefore all planes are the same and fly at the same speed with no control by the pilot.

Trains are operated by conductors and are variable speed, they speed up and slow down. At any given day a conductor could be running a train faster or slower for any number of reasons. They could be trying to make up time being late and running the train faster, they could have been tired and running the train slower to be safe or any number of other variables. There is no way to know the exact timing of the train that day unless you were there to time it.

Then the old man juror becomes an amateur criminal profiler and accuses the old man witness of lying to be important with no actual evidence to support this just his worthless opinion based on how he looks.

A juror not remembering the details of a movie is not an argument. The day a family member of mine died I have the movie I was watching seared into my head and will never forgot it. During times of increased stress like this you become hyper aware of everything.

The entire debate over how the suspect would have stabbed his dad is waste of time, all that matters was if it was plausible. How a juror would hold the knife is irrelevant.

Apparently the jurors have never heard of reading glasses or sunglasses which first became popular in the 1920's and The Stockbroker (Juror # 4) just decides to become an idiot on this point for no reason.

"Deceptively complex courtroom drama enthrals for the duration as one man opposes eleven others in a battle of argument, reason, and logic.

Starring Henry Fonda as Juror #8, 12 Angry Men is a very claustrophobic drama which conveys the deliberation room of a trial where the defendant is accused of first-degree murder. On the surface the case seems open and shut, with 11 of the 12 jurors entirely convinced by the prosecution's case. Only one dissenter remains, and that is Henry Fonda's Juror #8. Specifically he is not certain that the boy is definitely innocent, just that he doesn't know, and that for him is enough to qualify as reasonable doubt.

12 Angry Men certainly is a moralistic tale, of the right to a fair trial and trying to give someone every chance, but it has many more strings to its bow than just this. Indeed, above all else it prides itself in endeavouring to portray a true sense of reasoned and rational argument which tries to overcome steadfast beliefs as possessed by the seemingly unshakable. Initially it may seem that Fonda's Juror is simply playing devil's advocate, but it becomes clear that it is more about standing up for what you believe despite what the facts seem to tell you. The more you scrutinise so-called unshakable evidence, the more you find holes in it, and the more that logical analysis seems to provide the real answers.

Obviously, Juror #8 has to persuade those others who seem to have their own agenda, and pre-conceived notions of what truth equals, but nevertheless it is absolutely fascinating seeing how simply he probes the case and reveals the flaws.

The whole movie's pace is absolutely perfect, and given its almost exclusive setting of inside the deliberation room it is a testament to the genius of the script and the brilliance of the acting that the duration of the film seems so short. The cinematography is also surprisingly excellent given the lack of scope necessary, with sharp imagery and clever camera-work which gives the whole picture a real amount of life.

To detail the jurors themselves; Juror #1 reluctantly appoints himself foreman. He appears to lack esteem, and the chance to boss the table by being the 'leader' perversely appeals greatly to him as he lacks significant contribution to make about the case. He does not want to be useless, so is forced to take charge.

Juror #2 is a slight man who is clearly used to being wrapped in his own cocoon, never deviating, so when he ends up as a juror in a murder trial, he is actually thrilled at his fish out of water status. He does not really have much to say about the case, taking it at face value.

Juror #3 is the enduring Messenger Service owner. May have an ulterior motive for being so steadfastly sure the accused is guilty, given his first scene depicts ambivalence over the courtroom procedure given to him it is 'open and shut'. As time goes on, and evidence starts to suggest more than meets the eye, he begins to show emotional stress as his hardwired opinion looks flimsier. But he refuses to cave.

Juror #4 has more emotional attachment to the trial than most, as he shares the same kind of background to the defendant and takes criticism of 'that kind of person' extremely personally. Experiences inner conflict between head and heart.

Juror #5 is a cold and methodical thinker who has an elevated opinion of himself. Emerges more as the deliberations wear on, he is convinced by the evidence that the boy is guilty, and systematically sets about conveying this to the others.

Juror #6 is the common working man with very little input, and whose two significant moments are to defend another juror who is being harassed, and to suggest another juror is badly wrong about his opinion.

Juror #7 is more interested in the ball game at 8pm than the case. Doesn't want to be there, and while he details a little about the boy's background to start off with, his regular sarcastic quips throughout the story suggest he is simply desperate to be out of there as quickly as possible, with no care about the wheels of justice.

Juror #8 is the only juror who does not immediately join the others with their guilty verdict. He has a lot of thought about the case eating at him, and wishes to explore it. He meets much opposition.

Juror #9 is a wise, wiley old man who is sharper than anyone else and observed events in the courtroom closer than the others. Makes some smart observations which unearth vital truths.

Juror #10 is an old school racist whose opinion is based on prejudice and not facts. A vile and odious creature, he has no interest in 'people like that' roaming the streets, and is offended at having to live in the same city as them.

Juror #11 is an intelligent and interested spectator who listens to the facts and analyses them before reaching a conclusion. His European accent draws derision from some others, as does his general nationality, but he rises above it and provides some sensible comments, rarely saying anything which lacks thought.

Juror #12 is a good-natured man but not a terribly strong thinker. He does not have much of an independent opinion on the case, often following others, and is often more interested in playing naughts and crosses or boring fellow jurors about his job.

Overall, 12 Angry Men is simply as good as cinema can get. Incredible script, amazing performances, and captivating direction.

"Twelve-man jury decides the fate of a young man on trial for murder; eleven think the kid is guilty, the twelfth isn't so sure. Director Sidney Lumet makes his directorial debut here, and he's overly fond of riled-up actors shouting at the camera, but he doesn't stray from the proved path of this celebrated play by Reginald Rose, and that's a plus (the material stands quite well on its own). The claustrophobic, muggy atmosphere is rife with tension, and Henry Fonda is a tower of sanity as the only voice of reason. The film attempts to substitute the electricity of a live performance with too many tight shots of angry, sweaty faces, spitting and yelling, however this ensemble cast has a rich anti-camaraderie that puts the film across. *** from ****",twelveman juri decid fate young man trial murder eleven think kid guilti twelfth isnt sure director sidney lumet make directori debut he overli fond riledup actor shout camera doesnt stray prove path celebr play reginald rose that plu materi stand quit well the claustrophob muggi atmospher rife tension henri fonda tower saniti voic reason the film attempt substitut electr live perform mani tight shot angri sweati face spit yell howev ensembl cast rich anticamaraderi put film across,Neutral

"For its time, this movie must've been excellent. However, today it holds up as a good older movie that was filmed in black and white with many other older films in its time, shortly before, and shortly after surpassing it. Films such as Casablanca, Vertigo, North by Northwest, Gone With the Wind, Some Like It Hot, Sunset Boulevard, and many others are equally as good for this time period, and some are much better.

While I did appreciate and respect the movie and even liked it, I was very surprised at how high it was ranked on here at number five. There were no major plot twists, surprises, or even tour de force performances that you would also see in some other black and white older films. The concept was very interesting and kept my attention, but even some of the arguments and deductions that the jurors made were not truly logical. Some of them were intelligent, like when Henry Fonda measured the amount of time it would take for the older man witness to walk to the door, as well as when he proved he could purchase the weapon, but overall some of the points made were guesswork.

The truth is that at the end of the day, the director decides to paint Fonda's character as an ideal perfect person while clealry letting the culprit, likely guilty, walk free, which I felt betrayed the script's ambiguity. And to be totally honest, it would have been a much better movie, warranting a ranking of five all-time, if there was a plot twist that one of the juror's arguing for guilt was indeed the actual culrpit- a twist I was waiting and hoping for that I never got. Instead, we get a glorification of Fonda's character to the very end, ironically an antihero that wasn't truly meant to be that allowed the guilty one walk free.

"Title: ""12 Angry Men: A Timeless Masterpiece""In an age where the allure of modern blockbusters often overshadows the cinematic treasures of the past, Sidney Lumet's ""12 Angry Men"" stands as a testament to the enduring power of classic cinema. Released in 1957, this timeless masterpiece continues to captivate audiences with its gripping narrative and timeless themes. At first glance, the premise may seem simple: twelve jurors are tasked with deciding the fate of a young man accused of murder. But as the deliberations unfold within the confines of a claustrophobic jury room, the film delves deep into the complexities of human nature, exploring themes of prejudice, justice, and the power of empathy. What sets ""12 Angry Men"" apart is its masterful storytelling and impeccable craftsmanship. Shot almost entirely within the confines of a single room, the film relies on dialogue and character development to drive the narrative forward. Each juror brings their own biases and preconceptions to the table, leading to heated debates and intense confrontations that lay bare the flaws and foibles of the human condition. As the tension mounts and the stakes grow higher, the true brilliance of ""12 Angry Men"" shines through. Through the lens of the jury room, the film holds a mirror up to society, forcing viewers to confront their own prejudices and assumptions. In doing so, it transcends the confines of its era, offering timeless insights into the nature of justice and the power of collective action. But perhaps the greatest strength of ""12 Angry Men"" lies in its ability to resonate with audiences across generations. Despite being over six decades old, the film remains as relevant today as it was upon its release. Its exploration of themes such as systemic bias and the importance of due process continues to strike a chord in an age marked by social and political turmoil. Moreover, the performances of the cast elevate ""12 Angry Men"" to a level of cinematic excellence rarely seen. Led by Henry Fonda as Juror 8, the ensemble cast delivers performances that are as nuanced as they are compelling. Each actor brings depth and authenticity to their role, breathing life into characters that transcend the confines of the screen. As the credits roll and the final verdict is reached, ""12 Angry Men"" leaves an indelible impression on the viewer. It is a film that challenges conventions and defies expectations, reminding us of the power of cinema to provoke thought and inspire change. In a world inundated with flashy special effects and CGI-laden spectacles, ""12 Angry Men"" serves as a reminder of the timeless appeal of storytelling in its purest form. It is a film that reminds us of the importance of empathy, understanding, and the pursuit of justice - values that are as relevant today as they were in 1957. In conclusion, ""12 Angry Men"" is not just a movie; it is a timeless masterpiece that continues to captivate and inspire audiences with its powerful message and masterful execution.

"""12 Angry Men"" directed by Sidney Lumet is such an impressive study of minority influence that I will never forget seeing for the first time - 2011 In my social psychology class as an undergrad student.

Everything about this film is pure excellence. A genius script by Reginald Rose, fantastic acting - especially by Henry Fonda and Lee J. Cobb. It really is the simplicity of the story that makes the film shine.

"12 Angry Men is a very different thriller, it isn't even classified as one here on IMDb. But it is still a thriller nontheless, since it thrills, and boy does it thrill well !

It has no hidden bombs ready to detonate, no climactic shootout, no heroes getting imprisoned in the lair of the villains, but the suspense comes from one simple thing: the dialouge.

12 Angry Men is built on one of the better screenplays I have seen, and that is quite a feat since 90% of the movie takes place in one single room. But that is perhaps what makes it so tense and so great; the fact that you are stuck in one room with twelve very differing jurors divided into two groups, each of them trying to debunk the arguments of the opposing side over one question; is a teen convicted of first-degree murder guilty, or not guilty ? The heated conversations between the twelve delivers constant curveballs and plot twists, some quite shocking.

What I also love about the movie is the fact that it all seems like one take (comparisons can be made with the recent 1917 (2019), but perhaps not to the same extent). The excellent editing and the brilliant acting by all twelve jurors make sure of this.

I have seen people complaining over the lack of music in 12 Angry Men, but in my opinion, the dialouge serves as the music, if that makes any sense. It is a pure delight to listen to.

To conclude, 12 Angry Men is one of the best and most suspenseful movies I have ever seen, but in a very different way. It is a great shame that it is not as widely avaliable as some other highly rated IMDb titles, but perhaps that only adds to its factor of exclusivity.

"The best thing about this movie was watching the classic Hollywood and TV actors. The writing was good and is seldom found in movies today. Apart from that the film was nothing special.

After 20 minutes I could already see the end of the movie. Also I thought it a stretch that Henry Fonda's character could be so persuasive simply by standing his ground and saying 'maybe he's guilty and maybe he isn't.'

Perhaps its high IMDb rating is because a lot of people agree with the moral message it preaches. Maybe the moral message is 10 star but the movie is not. If you want to see a really good, classic, one scene, character study movie, check out Hitchcock's ""Lifeboat"".",the best thing movi watch classic hollywood tv actor the write good seldom found movi today apart film noth special after minut i could alreadi see end movi also i thought stretch henri fonda charact could persuas simpli stand ground say mayb he guilti mayb isnt perhap high imdb rate lot peopl agre moral messag preach mayb moral messag star movi if want see realli good classic one scene charact studi movi check hitchcock lifeboat,Positive
"Date: 18 May

-First Time Watch-

I watched this movie over the course of three days in my American Government class. By the end of the movie, more then half my class loved it. I didn't like it as much. Earlier this year we had watched 'Mr. Smith Goes to Washington' starring James Stewart. I found that one much more enjoyable since the characters did more then just sit around a table and discussing if a young boy really did kill his father or not. The story was slow, with a few surprises here and there but nothing spectacular. Our government teacher told us it was one of the best movies ever, according to the movie critics of that time, but I would have to disagree with the critics. It was just okay. Was it good to show to better understand the legal system? Yes. But, just for a movie to watch after a long week? Better keep looking.

The acting is top notch. I believe that monologue acting is quite a bit simpler than real reactive ensemble acting. Most of what we see today is monologues pretending to be conversations. But in this film, we have utter mastery of throwing emotions. Once the air becomes filled with human essence, it is hard to not get soaked ourselves as the camera moves through the thick atmosphere. Yes, there are slight differences in how each actor projects, but the ensemble presents one vision to the audience.",thi film deserv anyon list top film my problem perfect seamlessli polish hard appreci individu excel the act top notch i believ monologu act quit bit simpler real reactiv ensembl act most see today monologu pretend convers but film utter masteri throw emot onc air becom fill human essenc hard get soak camera move thick atmospher ye slight differ actor project ensembl present one vision audienc,Positive
"At its core 12 Angry Men is like an ode to the American legal system and justice in general.

Of whom what more can say other than they're all excellent.

The film and play its adapted from is a masterful work in writing and why it is what it is. However, don't let the impressive script and performances prevent you from noticing what a fine job Sydney Lumet did.

"In a Hollywood oversaturated with Star Wars, Jurassic Park, and superhero movies, the idea of a talented small group making a movie on a budget, sounds mortifying. 12 Angry Men proves not only that it can be done, but it can make one of the best films ever.

The movie begins with a judge telling 12 jurors to decide the fate of an accused boy. Then the 12 jurors go to a room to discuss the trial. And after they decide the boys fate the movie ends. Get a cast and crew of 20 talented people, and you can make it yourself.

The jurors discuss at length the events of the trial, as well as the crime which lead to it, all without any flashback scenes. When I first heard of it, I was worried it was going to be boring, but with strong performances from all jurors, great camera work, and a compelling case, I found myself under the trance of this masterpiece.

It's not always a comfortable movie. The jurors are constantly yelling, the camera is claustrophobic, and the characters get sweaty, and it captures the jurors just perfectly. The case was interesting enough to begin with, but as new evidence presents itself, the film constantly gets more fascinating as it progresses.

12 Angry Men is a film with a story to tell and it doesn't need a huge budget to tell it. I highly recommend, especially to the filmmakers of the future.",in hollywood oversatur star war jurass park superhero movi idea talent small group make movi budget sound mortifi angri men prove done make one best film ever the movi begin judg tell juror decid fate accus boy then juror go room discus trial and decid boy fate movi end get cast crew talent peopl make the juror discus length event trial well crime lead without flashback scene when i first heard i worri go bore strong perform juror great camera work compel case i found tranc masterpiec it alway comfort movi the juror constantli yell camera claustrophob charact get sweati captur juror perfectli the case interest enough begin new evid present film constantli get fascin progress angri men film stori tell doesnt need huge budget tell i highli recommend especi filmmak futur,Positive
"This movie makes you wonder whether the jury system is the best way of deciding the outcome of a court case. Twelve ""ordinary"" men and women decide the fate of the defendant - how many are objective about the process? Some bring personal prejudices into the jury room - others couldn't care less about the outcome. These points are effectively raised in the movie.

Even though the action is confined to one room, the dialogue kept me riveted to the screen till the end. All the actors portrayed the different personalities of the jurors very well.",thi movi make wonder whether juri system best way decid outcom court case twelv ordinari men woman decid fate defend mani object process some bring person prejudic juri room other couldnt care less outcom these point effect rais movi even though action confin one room dialogu kept rivet screen till end all actor portray differ person juror well,Positive
"The concept of 'Reasonable Doubt' is highly pervasive within the Judicial System; it is the concept that eventually decides the fates of the accused, and is the concept that is one of the most controversial. It's controversy lies in the fact that it is purely subjective, and dependent on the individuals that comprise the jury. The notion of Reasonable Doubt has no one definition, yet it is almost universally known. In 12 ANGRY MEN, Sidney Lumet successfully gives the viewer an idea of how this concept comes into play in a trial.

It is worth noting that while this may be one of the best courtroom movies of all time, it doesn't in fact occur in the actual courtroom; all but 3 or 4 minutes of this Motion Picture is spent in the confines of a Jury Room, where the verdict is hotly debated. Lumet does well to present the Room as a sort of confinement from which there is no escape until a unanimous verdict is decided. As the film progresses, the sense of urgency and claustrophobia sets in, and the tension becomes increasingly high. The first technique Lumet used was to employ the locked door. The second was to cue the rain, which gives the feeling that even the outdoors are 'inaccessible' and that only the Room exists. The third technique may be missed by less astute viewers; Lumet switches his scope from wide to narrow to close-up during the movie, which adds to the claustrophobic feeling mentioned earlier.

The acting is top-notch, as required by any good character study. All 12 men have been developed to some appreciable extent, but the key players have been developed to a comprehensive level given the film's ~95 minute run-time. Henry Fonda is brilliant as the 'hesitant' juror, but to me Lee J. Cobb outshines him in almost every scene (save the opening scenes).

Another aspect of the film worth mentioning is the Music (or lack thereof). This is another intentional ploy by Lumet to give the viewer a 'feel' of the Room. There is no Music in the Jury Room, so why should there be in this film? I agree that while a musical background score serves to enhance or capture the mood of the scene, sometimes the absence of the music (silence) speaks volumes, by allowing the viewer to concentrate fully on the scene(s). One of my favourite movies lacking in music is NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN. Another brilliant score-less Motion Picture is CAST AWAY, where no music is used for the entire length of time that Tom Hanks is stranded.

The screenplay is solid and intelligently sound. In fact the only thing that stopped this film from winning Best Picture, Best Director, and Best Screenplay was the excellent THE BRIDGE ON THE RIVER KWAI. Had the movie been made a year or two earlier, it may well have won the esteemed accolades.

I can see why this film ranks in IMDb's All-time Top 10. It is simply a brilliant Motion Picture that has wide appeal, and can be enjoyed and appreciated by many.

4 stars (out of 4). 8/10. Will appear in my Top 200 at around 167 or so.

"I have tried, and tried again to like this film. But I fail after the first fifteen minutes. For a start it is a Henry Fonda vehicle based on a television play. And sadly it still looks like and feels like a television play. The line up of actors like Ed Begley, Lee J. Cobb etc is impressive and they act well if over theatrically. Fonda is Fonda and I repeat he is the star and he does his best to shrug off his usual coldness on film. I have nothing against his acting except that I do not respond to his way of performing. A little more warmth, and being less dour I would perhaps, and it is a big perhaps, to respond to him better. So this for me is one of the fault lines in the film and his stabbing a knife on the table is a great moment. Being a big star the moment has tremendous impact, and no doubt most audiences are caught. As for the plot of the film it is about a youth who has to all intents committed a murder and twelve jurors debate about his going to the electric chair or not. I know it was 1957 and just maybe it was too daring to ask but no one questions capital punishment in itself, and twelve angry men could dispute that in itself but of course it is not on the table. The film is often praised for its camera movements, claustrophobic towards the end and less so at the beginning. The only unintended humour for me was one of the more elderly men taking too long in the toilet. Or bathroom in ' respectable ' terms and the latter is of course used. No spoilers to the ending.

"I am writing this review before reading any of the others, so as not to be influenced by them.

When I saw this film almost two decades ago I was absolutely riveted by the powerful, intense, unrelenting drama and suspense and the profound ethical content, not to mention the artistically uncompromising, sparse esthetics. The last scene, when Fonda walks out into the fresh air and gives a fond glance to the immense pillars of justice caused me to shed some tears, because I wasn't sure if I shared his abiding faith in the ultimate triumph of JUSTICE. In memory, the power of this film has faded, because it seems too comically optimistic. Justice ALWAYS triumphs in the end. It's a well-meaning, compassionate message, but it is also irresponsible. (Or is the message perhaps, that compassionate people should participate in juries more often?) True ethics and jurisprudence cannot afford such facile confidence. There is an insidious equation of law with justice. Every true legal mind, knows that the letter of the law can overwhelm the spirit of the law. Justice is just too big a topic for a movie!

"The only bad thing about this movie is that it ends, leaving the viewer with a bitter question : ""why aren't there movies like this anymore?"" No need for extravagant sets, no need for more than one room for the entire history of human race to unfold before our eyes. Looking inside of us, personally and as a species, we can all identify each and every one of the jurors. We all have acted indifferently, got carried away with anger, or with prejudice. We all are (or should be) capable of standing out for just causes like Henry Fonda's character. It's a question of choice, ethic and circumstance.

"Generally I consider one time enough to watch a movie, but this movie has so much depth in the dialogue that I felt I could watch it again right after it finished.

It is a deep dive in human psychology and how facts are perceived depending on the social surrounding. How each person sees the world from their own unique viewpoint. We will all recognize ourselves in one character or another and we see people we know portrayed on screen.

Now I did read a review about the high morality and feel-good vibe., but that is not really the essence of it. We will have to admit that, even though we want, we are unlikely that one person willing to stand up against everyone else. Probably most of us are like the majority of the group. Only willing to speak when we feel we have been granted safety by someone else willing to stand up against the loud people that overwhelm us. That makes the story feel real and engaging. It shows how quick people get drawn into the argumentation of those who simply are loud and confident. Most people are willing to listen provided they are granted the chance to be heard themselves. You have to dive deep and give them a chance to draw their own conclusions, within their own viewpoint. Forcing your argument only lasts as long as the receiver allows it.

"This film is a must see! No bells and whistles here, just the clear suspenseful plot of 12 men negotiating the future of a young man charged with murdering his father. Simply made, this black and white classic is nearly exclusively filmed in the confines of a small, hot, and miserable jurors room.

Juror #8, played by Henry Fonda, sets the standard initially with the sole ""Not Guilty"" vote. Each character then has to do some serious soul-searching to remove personal bias, conformity, and arrogance to properly perform their civic duty of determining the accused youth's fate. Sidney Lumet masterfully composes an instant classic by giving the viewers an inner look at individual and group conflict along with conflict resolution. This film is a great case study for communication styles for individuals and groups, as well.

Award winning acting, simplistic yet revealing dialogue, and before it's time camera angles and editing join together beautifully to create a suspense driven plot without the use of action, color, special effects, or an expensive budget.",thi film must see no bell whistl clear suspens plot men negoti futur young man charg murder father simpli made black white classic nearli exclus film confin small hot miser juror room juror play henri fonda set standard initi sole not guilti vote each charact seriou soulsearch remov person bia conform arrog properli perform civic duti determin accus youth fate sidney lumet master compos instant classic give viewer inner look individu group conflict along conflict resolut thi film great case studi commun style individu group well award win act simplist yet reveal dialogu time camera angl edit join togeth beauti creat suspens driven plot without use action color special effect expens budget,Positive
"However, collective intelligence and laborious pursuit of the truth itself sometimes take people near the truth. Twelve jurors are simplified integration of almost all types of people you can see in real life. Emotional one, smart one, reasonable one, wise one, rambling one, indecisive one, coward one, quiet one, loud one, and etc. I have never seen a movie with such a limited story and the setting. The whole move takes place in one setting: jurors' room and has one simple narrative: deciding defendant's guilt or innocence. However, it contains the whole society: how one's conviction can work in right or wrong way, what it takes to change others' opinions, what percentage of proportion is perfect between conviction and possibility, and how an individual deems 'the life'.

One thing I have particularly noticed is the temperature in the room and the weather outside. Because the room is stuffed, and all jurors are sweating, stress, pressure and unpleasantness in decision making process is thoroughly conveyed to the audience. The level of griminess peaks when the vote reaches six to six. Then, it rains, and a fan starts to work, forecasting pleasant momentum toward resolution or settlement. I also want to praise the camera work. It intensifies the sense of confined space without disturbing actors' delivery of emotion. When it is the vital moment of discovery of evidence, the camera closes up the actor with the line. However, other times, scenes are shot across the room vertically, emphasizing the narrowness with many people overlapping some parts of their body.

I will not deny '12 Angry Men' is philosophical art. However, it does not do enough to overcome the weakness this movie is born with, no dynamics and too linear because of finite story and setting. It misses out on most of what 'motion pictures' can offer.",howev collect intellig labori pursuit truth sometim take peopl near truth twelv juror simplifi integr almost type peopl see real life emot one smart one reason one wise one rambl one indecis one coward one quiet one loud one etc i never seen movi limit stori set the whole move take place one set juror room one simpl narr decid defend guilt innoc howev contain whole societi one convict work right wrong way take chang other opinion percentag proport perfect convict possibl individu deem life one thing i particularli notic temperatur room weather outsid becaus room stuf juror sweat stress pressur unpleas decis make process thoroughli convey audienc the level grimi peak vote reach six six then rain fan start work forecast pleasant momentum toward resolut settlement i also want prais camera work it intensifi sen confin space without disturb actor deliveri emot when vital moment discoveri evid camera close actor line howev time scene shot across room vertic emphas narrow mani peopl overlap part bodi i deni angri men philosoph art howev enough overcom weak movi born dynam linear finit stori set it miss motion pictur offer,Positive
"I watched this film for the first time at the age of 18. I must admit that in the very beginning of the movie, I thought it seemed like just another boring ""old"" movie. But as the story unfolds you get to see more and more of the Jury's personality, through the way they behave and what they say. The writers of this movie did an amazing job creating twelve so distinctly different characters, and that's what makes this movie interesting. The setting and the scene is as simple as it gets, and I would guess the movie budget was very low. Yet I got the feeling that it was very professionally made. I must say the actors did also did a really good job, and as in any classical movie, the ending is closely based on absolutely everything that happens during the whole movie.

Now the movie itself... I was sitting 1,5 hours captivated by a black/white feature all taking place in one room with just talking...

The reason for this was the amazing acting by everyone involved. The characters really grab you, and you hang on every word. It is clear that these actors were ""forced"" to be more skillful, they had no special effects to cover their shortcomings.

"I love my kino, and love my classics, so let's get down to brass tacks as to why I give this a 6.

* The movie is timeless. It could have been shot in any decade.

* The movie was well ahead of its time in terms of photography

... and that's about it.

But, just like the jurors in ""12AM"", we must look beyond the 'facts'.

* First, the acting. It's superb at times, and really quaint not-in-a-good way in others. So while the photography has not aged one bit, the acting and the characterization has.

* Second, the plot line. There's so much good stuff in there, it's so well paced, that it's too easy to overlook the bad: the ending is as flat as they come (bombastic trumpets of the victor leaving the court in his white suit, really?), and the ""Kaiser Sauze"" moment that's hinted at from the beginning never comes. Ergo, it's didactic, and ergo, it's not that ""mind blowing"" at all.

* Third, it's a movie that's getting a lot of good ratings because of the current political climate. It's easy to call this timeless while taking down a disney attraction because it's linked to ""Song of the South"". It's also convenient to honour a movie that references the constitution amendment while ignoring that 2A is a thing. Funny how college in the US pick their 'Timeless classics"".

If someone asked you to create a compelling film, shot in only one location, black and white, a dozen actors, no fancy camera work, almost non-stop dialogue, and based entirely on an argument, could you do it?

Well, 12 Angry Men rises to that exact occasion. If you're one that appreciates some mystery, drama, a rollercoaster of a ride, you'll enjoy this movie. Granted it's not for all, its lack of action, romance or Michael Bay explosions may have some falling asleep, but to those who appreciate a good thriller, it'll have you on the edge of your seat the whole time.

It's easy to become desensitized today about what truly makes a good movie, with CGI a norm, relying solely on A list actors and actresses instead of a good screenplay prolific, we forget just how powerful well-written dialogue is. It's that dialogue that transports you into this movie, that thrusts you into the whirlwind of plot and emotion and doesn't let go until the movie's over. You walk away from this film in awe, not thinking well if 100 million dollars falls in my lap I could make a movie like that. No, you start thinking, damn, I have no excuse, this movie proves that it's story that matters, not extravagant displays of big budgets.

"What is there to be said that hasn't already been said? It's earned it's status as a classic for a reason. While I wouldn't go so far as to call it one of the greatest of all time, it is a vastly entertaining take on a brilliant premise that has been used throughout the decades sense. The dialogue is sharp, the character turns are believable and interesting and the whole thing flows along at a swift pace. When it was over I couldn't believe that so much time had gone by. I'm always fascinated by films that take place entirely in one location (or almost entirely) and this was one of the early precedents for the kind of greatness one can accomplish when that is utilized properly.

The ominous surroundings like the heat and the storm add nice bits of tension to the rising tempers of the men in the room and the confrontations between the soft Henry Fonda and the explosive Lee J. Cobb were intense. Sidney Lumet is a man who earned his reputation as an ""actor's director"" and made his career out of mostly setting up the stage and aiding his actors in doing what they do best, but I think his stylistic choices here deserve to be commended. The way that he slowly brings the camera down over the course of the film, bringing us more intimately into the heart of this room, it adds that sense of claustrophobia that makes the tension even more gripping as we proceed into the later stages of it all.

Practically everyone in the cast shines at one point or another, my favorites being the commanding Fonda who is able to be the voice of reason without being annoying, the pensive E.G. Marshall, the racist and volatile Ed Begley and the wise, determined Joseph Sweeney. The film had plenty of great twists, like the knife reveal, but my favorite scene had to be Begley going off on his offensive monologue while one-by-one the jurors turned away from him until he realized that his ignorance had caused him to lose any voice he once had; a powerfully real moment. I also loved the added touch of putting Fonda in an all white suit while everyone else was in shades of black or grey.",what said hasnt alreadi said it earn statu classic reason while i wouldnt go far call one greatest time vastli entertain take brilliant premis use throughout decad sen the dialogu sharp charact turn believ interest whole thing flow along swift pace when i couldnt believ much time gone im alway fascin film take place entir one locat almost entir one earli preced kind great one accomplish util properli the omin surround like heat storm add nice bit tension rise temper men room confront soft henri fonda explos lee j cobb intens sidney lumet man earn reput actor director made career mostli set stage aid actor best i think stylist choic deserv commend the way slowli bring camera cours film bring u intim heart room add sen claustrophobia make tension even grip proceed later stage practic everyon cast shine one point anoth favorit command fonda abl voic reason without annoy pensiv eg marshal racist volatil ed begley wise determin joseph sweeney the film plenti great twist like knife reveal favorit scene begley go offens monologu onebyon juror turn away realiz ignor caus lose voic power real moment i also love ad touch put fonda white suit everyon el shade black grey,Positive
"Here's a film made only in a room that looks hot and humid and only on a budget of $349,000. The twelve jurors must decide unanimously on a case of first degree murder whether the accused is guilty or not guilty. When they walk into a jury room which is both hot and humid they become acquainted with the personalities of their peers at first.Then they do a vote with the motive of finishing that taken-for granted murder case.However right at that moment they realize that one of the jurors doesn't like the quick open and shut situation of the case and he says ""it needed to be talked"" based on his reasonable doubt! Because it's not an unanimous voting the case need to be talked then a whole set of serious arguments ensues.Sifting of the evidence disclose the errors of the prosecution's case, the doubtful representation by the defendant's court-appointed attorney, and the true inner-deep character of each of the jury members.Well that's what I love just a room twelve people..one man a lone dissenter force the others to think why they vote yes why they don't no.He forces them to share a responsibility and he is even tactful enough to mention that the accused kid has been subjected to violence..that he needs more than just a fair-looking trial before sending him to the chair.Henry Fonda as the cool,calm and wise questioning one dissenter is just awesome the other 11 days are good too but Joseph Sweeney as the wise and observant elderly man named McCardle caught my attention too!

Later on in this powerful tale, he manages to persuade the other jurors that the accused might be innocent with his skills of analyzing legal matters.

What surprised me the most was this: Usually, courtroom dramas often begin with a shot of the crime scene that took place whereas this movie starts directly with the jurors' discussion. It doesn't even have a trial but still has a capability to mesmerize people's minds with just ONE shot in ONE room. The heated discussion between the jurors along with the twists and turns in the statements of the witness, makes this movie greatly enthralling. I watched this movie with my family and all of us got so indulged in the movie that we found every scene fascinating. Besides, all the actors did a fabulous job being in a different character's shoe. Each juror had different thoughts and approaches towards the matter and the actors wonderfully embodied it.

Thus, I think that this flawless movie is a must-watch for every person who adores trials and courtroom dramas.",thi marvel stori late jurorhenri fonda along juror tri come reason verdict murder trial he believ accus case innoc begin person particular opinion later power tale manag persuad juror accus might innoc skill analyz legal matter what surpris usual courtroom drama often begin shot crime scene took place wherea movi start directli juror discus it doesnt even trial still capabl mesmer peopl mind one shot one room the heat discus juror along twist turn statement wit make movi greatli enthral i watch movi famili u got indulg movi found everi scene fascin besid actor fabul job differ charact shoe each juror differ thought approach toward matter actor wonder embodi thu i think flawless movi mustwatch everi person ador trial courtroom drama,Neutral
"12 Angry Man is a brilliant movie about the value of a human life. Essentially, it is a discussion between 12 jurors who must decide on the life of a young man. The film takes place in real time and deals with important issues such as human morality and the fact that our decisions are shaped by our own experiences, prejudices and even selfishness. Each of the 12 men is different, has a unique profession that reflects his personality, and has had his own experiences in life. As a viewer, it's just exciting to see each perspective and how each one tries to argue. If there's one thing the film taught me, it's that our society only works as a whole, and only together can anything be achieved.",angri man brilliant movi valu human life essenti discus juror must decid life young man the film take place real time deal import issu human moral fact decis shape experi prejudic even selfish each men differ uniqu profess reflect person experi life a viewer excit see perspect one tri argu if there one thing film taught societi work whole togeth anyth achiev,Neutral
"A great film. I've only even seen parts at different times. I always meant to sit down and watch the whole thing, but too much to do lately, I work. Luckily, AMC is showing it often, so maybe I'll see the whole thing.

But for now - here are my thoughts: Henry Fonda is superb - did the kid really do it? I still don't know. But the character actor suppport is audacious! Everyone is in there - Jack Klugman, Ed Begley, Sr., Martin Balsam, Jack Warden, E.G. Marhshall, what more can we want in black and white? That's when the camera operators show their greatness.

I think 1939 was the greatest film year of all - Grapes of Wrath, Wizard of Oz, and the very special Gone With the Wind.

I watch old black and whites whenever I can - Bette Davis, Claudette Colbert, Veronica Lake (So Proudly We Hail), Lauren Bacall, Clark Gable (my favorite), Humphrey Bogart (Deadline USA'52 is a favorite besides Casablanca), James Stewart (FBI Story one of his best here), they are all the greats. Not one to touch them these days.

Curiously, though - I like the new Drew Barrymore. She's become a woman.

"It seems that this movie is unanimously a masterpiece, a 9/10, and according to the list, the #5 best movie of all time according to IMDB.

I'm going to be the dissenting juror to this conviction. While the movie is undoubtedly very good for its time and for being a black and white movie, I believe it is overrated at its score and where it sits in the top 5. I'm astonished this is as high ranked and rated actually.

It's like the jurors in the room pressuring everybody to side with their opinion, and anybody who doesn't agree with their assertion is outcasted and must give into peer pressure and consent to a 9/10. However, not me, I give this very good movie a 7/10, and I could see it in the 90-100 ranked range, maybe the 50 range at best.

There is practically no action, no big twists, and no grand surprises. There were just a couple of scenes such as where Fonda's character pulls out the knife or when the angry juror demonstrates the angle of the knife on Fonda that created some tension, but most of it is too even and simplistic to be considered great. Sure, the arguments brought up by the characters were often interesting and valid, but they were just using step by step logic that wasn't overly cerebral. That's fine, but the point is that there was no big mindblowing 'aha' moment. It was just a step by step chiseling of the evidence that was again interesting at some times, but at others it was just basic.

There was definitely a lot to learn from in this movie in terms of how a jury works if one has never been on one, as well as how the system works regarding arriving at verdicts. I'm sure for its time, it was very enlightening for people unfamiliar with the constitution, and even today there are timeless elements to the study of the situation.

I have one more minor criticism. While Fonda's acting was good, I found his character to be a little bit too much portrayed like an angel. The director even has him place the most angry juror's jacket on him at the end, and the camera just about solely focuses in on him at the end. They didn't even include the reading of the final verdict or show the boy's or the attorneys' reactions or the courtroom's. I mean, come on, Fonda's character may have just convinced eleven other men to let the culprit walk free, and yet the director paints him as a basically perfect person, like an angel. I think this betrays the script in a sense because there was ample evidence that the boy was guilty, not because of the pathetic prejudicial arguments or preconceptions of character, but because of some other key pieces of evidence. For example, just because juror four can't remember the exact name of the movie he saw or struggles to recall the actor names shouldn't be enough to disregard the boy's statements. I'm not saying he was definitely guilty, but the way the script was playing out, I don't think it was clear enough to pain Fonda's character as this perfect person the way they did, especially at the end, although this could be a trope of the times in the 1950's to always have a hero be idealized.

In summation, it is a very good movie, but I probably wouldn't watch it again as it is rather monotonous with very little action if any at all and very few twists. Still, I'm glad I watched it once and would put it in the top 30 or so of black and white movies, but definitely not in the top 5 movies of all time. Just off the top of my head, Casablanca, It's a Wonderful Life, The Birds, Rear Window, Vertigo, and Gone With the Wind are better older movies than this was.",it seem movi unanim masterpiec accord list best movi time accord imdb im go dissent juror convict while movi undoubtedli good time black white movi i believ overr score sit top im astonish high rank rate actual it like juror room pressur everybodi side opinion anybodi doesnt agre assert outcast must give peer pressur consent howev i give good movi i could see rank rang mayb rang best there practic action big twist grand surpris there coupl scene fonda charact pull knife angri juror demonstr angl knife fonda creat tension even simplist consid great sure argument brought charact often interest valid use step step logic wasnt overli cerebr that fine point big mindblow aha moment it step step chisel evid interest time other basic there definit lot learn movi term juri work one never one well system work regard arriv verdict im sure time enlighten peopl unfamiliar constitut even today timeless element studi situat i one minor critic while fonda act good i found charact littl bit much portray like angel the director even place angri juror jacket end camera sole focus end they didnt even includ read final verdict show boy attorney reaction courtroom i mean come fonda charact may convinc eleven men let culprit walk free yet director paint basic perfect person like angel i think betray script sen ampl evid boy guilti pathet prejudici argument preconcept charact key piec evid for exampl juror four cant rememb exact name movi saw struggl recal actor name shouldnt enough disregard boy statement im say definit guilti way script play i dont think clear enough pain fonda charact perfect person way especi end although could trope time alway hero ideal in summat good movi i probabl wouldnt watch rather monoton littl action twist still im glad i watch would put top black white movi definit top movi time just top head casablanca it wonder life the bird rear window vertigo gone with wind better older movi,Positive
"It just goes to show, you can have the largest budget, the greatest special effects and the most explosive action, but all a film really needs is a great script and a great cast, and '12 Angry Men' is a testament to that. Despite being over 60 years old now, this is rightly still considered by many to be one of the best films of all time.

Despite virtually the entirety of this film being set in one room, this has to be one of the most compelling dramas I've seen. For a film with such a simple format, it had me hooked from start to finish.

The characters are fascinating, they all have depth and back stories, come from different backgrounds and walks of life and each have unique characteristics and personalities. The script is also excellent, a masterpiece in itself.

Maybe the first five minutes I heard a few comments about boring black and white movies but that went away as soon as the initial vote was taken in the jury room.

"I saw 12 Angries for the 4th time last night. I knew every line and reaction and was still engrossed to the end. The are maybe a couple dozen movies I can say that about.

To be honest, I think some of the dialog and a couple of the plot points are weak, but Lumet's direction keeps the movie moving seamlessly forward. All the actors are good, with Ed Begley, EG Marshall and Henry Fonda particularly so. It is Lee J. Cobb, however, that stands out for me. So powerful yet nuanced. Near the end, after Cobb recounts ""every single"" reason he thinks the kid is guilty, John Fiedler says ""You said we could throw out all the other evidence"" Cobb's reaction of bewilderment and frustration rang so true I have a hard time believing he was acting.

A fun exercise is to figure out the juror you most identify with. For me it is Fonda. Thoughtful, respectful, balanced, and cautious.

"It's a movie that takes place in one hot, smoke-filled, sweaty room, at a time when men felt naked if they took their jacket and tie off. 11 come into the room wanting to fry the defendant; one man starts pointing out all the ambiguous testimony. He nobly upholds the concept of ""reasonable doubt."" Guess who triumphs?

The movie is remarkable. Sidney Lumet was even then a master filmmaker. The claustrophobia is palpable, but the camera is fluid enough to give you every angle on the closed, locked room, and every emotion and bead of sweat on the men trapped there.

The story, however, presents easy heroes and villains: the everyman just trying to make sure justice is done; the bigot who can't keep his opinions to himself; the noble immigrant. Cliches all, even back in 1957.

Yet, the cast is so real. These are real, sweaty, down-to-earth actors putting on the performances of their lives. You always feel like you are in there with them, following the logic, thinking about whether the evidence presented is believable.

"12 men debating over the fate of a boy who was suspected of killing his father. 12 different personalities and an array of interests, the debates portrayed the importance of listening, understanding, respect and empathy.

It is vital we disentangle perceptions and emotions from the problem. As perceptions are shaped by varied experiences and values, an array of perceptions is undeniable in any negotiation. However, allowing perceptions to determine our views on the problem at hand is detrimental as it not only leads to an obscuration of truth, but also an inaccurate basis upon which we make a decision. For example, Juror 10, with his preconceived prejudices against slum-dwellers as a result of his experience living among them, voted ""Guilty"". This prejudice undeniably resulted in a biased view, ignoring the fact that experiences are varied and more crucially, doing no justice to the boy. This is further compounded when his prejudice was taken as a personal attack by Juror 5 who lived in a slum before, engendering a flurry of emotions. In this regard, it is evident that perceptions and emotions are intricately entwined and it is crucial that we attack the problem, not the people (Fisher and Ury, 2012).

In light of varied perceptions, it is important that interests of individuals are made explicit. This is so as when we begin to ask ""WHY?"", inaccurate perceptions and selfish interests could be teased out, allowing us to see how each side has multiple interests. For example, within the ""Guilty"" side, a range of interests was noticed – where Juror 7's interest lied in wanting to ""get out of here"", while Juror 3's problematic interest stemmed from his strained relationship with his son. Insodoing, we would be able to correct inaccurate and biased perceptions, while respecting and understanding the basic concerns of others.

At the core of it, clear communication and active listening of interests, alongside values of respect and empathy, are crucial in ensuring efficiency and an improvement or maintenance of relationships.",men debat fate boy suspect kill father differ person array interest debat portray import listen understand respect empathi it vital disentangl percept emot problem a percept shape vari experi valu array percept undeni negoti howev allow percept determin view problem hand detriment lead obscur truth also inaccur basi upon make decis for exampl juror preconceiv prejudic slumdwel result experi live among vote guilti thi prejudic undeni result bias view ignor fact experi vari crucial justic boy thi compound prejudic taken person attack juror live slum engend flurri emot in regard evid percept emot intric entwin crucial attack problem peopl fisher uri in light vari percept import interest individu made explicit thi begin ask whi inaccur percept selfish interest could tea allow u see side multipl interest for exampl within guilti side rang interest notic juror interest lie want get juror problemat interest stem strain relationship son insodo would abl correct inaccur bias percept respect understand basic concern other at core clear commun activ listen interest alongsid valu respect empathi crucial ensur effici improv mainten relationship,Neutral

"A story about 12 men who come from different background, a different point of view, different goals, different motive, and different argument to act as juries facing a complicated murder case. When 11 of them thought it was an easy decision to make, there was also effort from Juror 8 (Henry Fonda) to reveal what was really happened with the case and save a boy's life form death sentence. This film shows what logic can do to break prejudice and how a single decision can decide on a boy's life.

Set of the place is one of the most important parts of a film. 12 Angry Men is unique because it only has one set of place located in the juror's room. But, if we thought this film will be boring because only has one set of place, we must be terribly wrong. Sidney Lumet has successfully directed the film with intense argument and interesting interaction between the jurors without forgetting ""the simpleness"" itself. All of the actors successfully drive their emotional expression towards the discussion. The dialogue is brilliant, genius, and remarkable, it makes all of the characters have their own signature and characteristics. The most important thing is this film didn't tell us who is the real murderer of the case. But only to decide whether the boy is guilty or not.

This is such a masterpiece from Sidney Lumet, the main idea of the movie is to decide someone's life.

"Recently my housemate and I had a film marathon involving SCANNERS and TRUE LIES, two films I have seen before and will see again. After these two he suggested '12 Angry Men' a film I had never heard of before and wasn't really in the mood for. I was very wrong. The film itself is excellent and a true calling card for the classic and noir period. A period where anger is displayed through shouting, not shooting, and this shouting is done using the English language...not a flurry of abuse we are so used to these days. I am blathering I know BUT this film surprised me, made me laugh, worried me, interested me and angered me, all the things that a very good film really should do.

The fact that all of this came from a film where the characters are in one room for 98% of the run time is an even bigger example of the timelessness of the piece. I will be watching this again.

"I cannot believe I was forced to endure this movie in a class I took at college. Synopsis: 12 men sit in a room and talk for the ENTIRE movie. It's about as fun as sitting in the doctor's office listening to the chit-chat of other patients.

Also, some of the ""evidence"" presented to defend the accused is sketchy, at best. It seems too many jurors have taken this movie to heart -- in this country we turn people like O.J. Simpson out on the street.

I might have liked to read this as a book, where I could at least dream up my own characters and give them more to do besides sit and talk. The two main characters were also pretty flat; one is your all-enlightened bleeding heart liberal who thinks a crack dealer that has been arrested 42 times will straighten up if given ""just one more shot at 'rehab'."" The other is the typical conservative loudmouth whose values are rock-solid and self-righteous and he's going to scream louder and louder until you agree with him. This movie isn't suspensful, it's laughable.

"12 angry men is a courtroom drama based on the premise that all defendants deserve a fair trial until proved guilty. The film is a very simplistic take on the presumption of innocence and takes place almost entirely within a small New York City court room as 12 men debate the fate of a young defendant charged with murdering his father. In the start all jurors think of the case as an open and shut case except one; Juror No. 8 played by Henry Fonda. But as they discuss the the available evidence, it turns out it is not simple as it seems to be. Most of the jurors are prejudiced and it takes the staunch effort from the character played by Fonda to induce logic and sense into the proceedings.

The film builds tension through conflict among the jurors and the dialogue. The length is only 95 minutes but it feels as if it is shot in real time. The direction and camera-work is excellent. The jurors are all well defined in terms of their personalities, occupations, prejudices and the emotional reasons behind those prejudices. All the cast members make an excellent effort into bringing these characters to life.

The movie is not about solving the crime although all the available evidence is heavily discussed, it is about the jury passing a judgment on the life of a boy. It is a take on the strength of the jury and their power to decide a man's survival and it performs this job in an excellent manner. The movie is a rare gem and I highly recommend it to anyone who loves great cinema.",angri men courtroom drama base premis defend deserv fair trial prove guilti the film simplist take presumpt innoc take place almost entir within small new york citi court room men debat fate young defend charg murder father in start juror think case open shut case except one juror no play henri fonda but discus avail evid turn simpl seem most juror prejud take staunch effort charact play fonda induc logic sen proceed the film build tension conflict among juror dialogu the length minut feel shot real time the direct camerawork excel the juror well defin term person occup prejudic emot reason behind prejudic all cast member make excel effort bring charact life the movi solv crime although avail evid heavili discus juri pas judgment life boy it take strength juri power decid man surviv perform job excel manner the movi rare gem i highli recommend anyon love great cinema,Positive
"The life is made up of choices we make every single day, from small things like what to eat for breakfast and what movie to watch in spare time to the big things like the vacation plans or mortgage engagements. We are so used to choosing we do it instantaneously, without any further investigations - and that is often the case with the things we think are right because if we are right it means that everyone else who thinks differently is wrong. People were, are and will always be stubborn and narrow-minded because they are a majority and one can only guess what will happen when that changes.

1957's ""12 angry men"" is a splendid courtroom drama which was a directorial debut for Sidney Lumet and starred an ensemble cast of great actors - Henry Fonda, Lee J. Cobb, Martin Balsam, Jack Klugman, Ed Begley and many others. The film is set almost entirely in one room where the jury must decide whether a man on trial for murder is guilty and it showcases all there is to love about the art of cinema: tensions, eloquent and well-thought out dialogues, outstanding performances, masterful camera work and most of all - the presence effect.

Together with the jurors we examine every piece of evidence, every statement, every witness so that not only they can come to the unanimous conclusion but also to put ourselves in the shoes of a person convicted and admit that there is a reasonable doubt and to state so in our final judgment, and it's no easy task. It's not difficult to stand out from the crowd but it's so much harder to stoop down to it everytime you're pressured into thinking, doing, believing something or behaving the way the rest is - you have to stand firmly where you are and be a human no matter what and maybe, just maybe, the angry people around you will see the whole picture more clearly.

"Most films featuring ensemble casts include up to a handful of 'main characters', alongside a slew of secondary characters that never receive very thorough characterization. I was stunned at how deep and fleshed out every single one of the 12 jurors was in 12 Angry Men.

Fighting to dominate the screen might be better phrasing than 'sharing' the screen.

If you like seeing how people logically deconstruct a case in order to prove/disprove the defendants guilt this is the right movie for you.

"In spite of being recommended multiple times, I only got to watch this masterpiece during the months of quarantine in 2020 and I was really surprised. Alongside being a masterfully crafted film, the most important aspect was how this film was way ahead for its time being released in 1957.

It follows the tension between 12 jurors locked in a room who must arrive at a unanimous decision to convict an 18 year old who is accused of murdering his own father that at the first glance looks like an open and shut case. However, when one of them decides the other way, each one must face their own prejudices and moral burdens as reality is put into trial. It deals with multiple themes. most importantly the idea of democracy, racism, xenophobia and the dangers of preconceived ideas. The screenplay is sharp and the tension between the characters keeps you on the edge of your seat throughout the film. What results is a rare courtroom drama that takes outside of the court but creates more impact than a lot of new age courtroom films.",in spite recommend multipl time i got watch masterpiec month quarantin i realli surpris alongsid master craft film import aspect film way ahead time releas it follow tension juror lock room must arriv unanim decis convict year old accus murder father first glanc look like open shut case howev one decid way one must face prejudic moral burden realiti put trial it deal multipl theme importantli idea democraci racism xenophobia danger preconceiv idea the screenplay sharp tension charact keep edg seat throughout film what result rare courtroom drama take outsid court creat impact lot new age courtroom film,Neutral

"I completely recognize that 12 Angry Men is a classic, but it's just not my favorite old movie. If Lee J. Cobb didn't give such a fantastic performance, I wouldn't like it at all. As many plays do (although this movie was originally a television production and subsequently adapted to the stage), it has a definite message and tries as hard as possible to convince the audience that the writer is correct. Unfortunately, I wasn't convinced. I maintained my belief that in the United States of America, everyone is entitled to his own opinion. Lee J. Cobb nearly echoes this sentiment verbatim in the film, with extreme passion. Henry Fonda (and writer Reginald Rose) argue that in the United States, the ""reasonable doubt"" portion of the jury system is more important than every man's right to a different opinion.

In essence, the jury starts the film seemingly all decided to decide guilty to a murder trial. While giving their preliminary vote in the back room, Hank realizes he will be the only one with the power to prolong the discussion. If he votes guilty with the rest, the deliberation (and the movie) will be over. So, he votes not-guilty, and forces the other eleven men to re-think things. But it isn't really fair, if you're on Lee's side of the story. If you're on Team Hank, this might be one of your favorite movies of all time. A truly impartial jury is nearly impossible, as anyone who's ever had an opinion or life experience that shaped their views. Any of those twelve men is entitled to his opinion, but this film argues that peer pressure should be more powerful than individuality. As Hank brow-beats other jurors into voting not-guilty, Lee and a few others remain firm. Will it turn out to be a hung jury, or will the American justice system prevail?

One aspect of the film I will compliment is the setting. The movie starts with the jurors walking into the deliberation room, and the entire movie takes place there. We never see the trial or hear evidence; everything is the discussion. It's an interesting style, because the point is not for the audience to get involved in the case or to make up their own minds. The point is, as mentioned, that if the jury has a reasonable doubt, they must acquit. The cast is also a great asset to the film. All professionals, all giving their unique characters their all - although I do wish the original lead from television was kept on for the movie. Franchot Tone can act circles around Henry Fonda, and he has integrity, passion, and class; he was traded in for a monotonous, whiny voiced bad actor.

Still, Martin Balsam, John Fiedler, E. G. Marshall, Jack Klugman, Edward Binns, Jack Warden, Joseph Sweeney, Ed Begley, George Voskovec, Robert Webber, and of course, Lee J. Cobb, are exactly what the film calls for. Lee couldn't have been any better, and it pained us at the Hot Toasty Rag Awards that he didn't take home the newspaper award for Best Supporting Actor. There was enormously stiff competition in that 1957 category, and all the nominees were truly winners.",i complet recogn angri men classic favorit old movi if lee j cobb didnt give fantast perform i wouldnt like a mani play although movi origin televis product subsequ adapt stage definit messag tri hard possibl convinc audienc writer correct unfortun i wasnt convinc i maintain belief unit state america everyon entitl opinion lee j cobb nearli echo sentiment verbatim film extrem passion henri fonda writer reginald rose argu unit state reason doubt portion juri system import everi man right differ opinion in essenc juri start film seemingli decid decid guilti murder trial while give preliminari vote back room hank realiz one power prolong discus if vote guilti rest deliber movi so vote notguilti forc eleven men rethink thing but isnt realli fair your lee side stori if your team hank might one favorit movi time a truli imparti juri nearli imposs anyon who ever opinion life experi shape view ani twelv men entitl opinion film argu peer pressur power individu a hank browbeat juror vote notguilti lee other remain firm will turn hung juri american justic system prevail one aspect film i compliment set the movi start juror walk deliber room entir movi take place we never see trial hear evid everyth discus it interest style point audienc get involv case make mind the point mention juri reason doubt must acquit the cast also great asset film all profession give uniqu charact although i wish origin lead televis kept movi franchot tone act circl around henri fonda integr passion class trade monoton whini voic bad actor still martin balsam john fiedler e g marshal jack klugman edward binn jack warden joseph sweeney ed begley georg voskovec robert webber cours lee j cobb exactli film call lee couldnt better pain u hot toasti rag award didnt take home newspap award best support actor there enorm stiff competit categori nomine truli winner,Positive
"I realized, watching ""12 Angry Men,"" what an intensely political film it is. The term ""ahead of its time,"" is one I try to avoid, since no person, whether artist or businessman, is ahead of their time. They are, inextricably, unavoidably, a part of their time. But this is a film made in 1957--that's a pretty long time ago, culturally speaking--and it's still inarguably timely. The lead character, Henry Fonda (Juror #8), tries to force people out of making a decision based solely on race and personal convenience. The jury is deliberating a murder conviction, a young immigrant accused of stabbing his father, with ample circumstantial evidence that any ""good"" citizen could stand by if they needed to justify their vote. Most of the jury member want to get the decision over and done with hastily; they have personal errands on their minds, games they want to watch, people they prefer to see. And it's hot that day, very hot--air conditioning is not an option. Under these conditions, Fonda asks much of his fellow jurors: he asks them to put aside thier usual concerns for their own schedules; he demands that they dislodge many years of easy prejudices corroding their judgment; he pleads that they take the time to try and reconstruct other people's points of view, something most of these men clearly don't make a habit of. It's poignant toward the conclusion, after the men leave the courthouse, when one man admiringly asks Fonda his name. They exhange surnames, and then part, realizing either that they're incapable of small talk with each other after such a momentous moral experience--or perhaps that they have nothing in common now that they've emerged into the light of day.

I don't think Lumet is viewed as political filmmaker as he truly is. ""12 Angry Men"" was his film debut, an astonishing accomplishment. But think of many of his subsequent films: a documentary on Martin Luther King's journeys; ""Serpico,"" which charts the crusade of a copy compelled to question an entrenched system that wasn't working very well; the ""Pawnbroker,"" is another powerful film, about how a concentration camp survivor tries to avoid dealing with the moral complications of the outside world once he's back in it; ""Dog Day Afternoon"" is about a character who is fed up with not having enough money for all the human responsibilities pulling at him. The protagonists in these films are all people that confront or have confronted systems of discrimination, be they racial or economic. And there is nothing more political than examining tyrannies. It's a brave body of work, one to be admired, and ""12 Angry Men"" is a great place to start.",i realiz watch angri men intens polit film the term ahead time one i tri avoid sinc person whether artist businessman ahead time they inextric unavoid part time but film made that pretti long time ago cultur speakingand still inargu time the lead charact henri fonda juror tri forc peopl make decis base sole race person conveni the juri deliber murder convict young immigr accus stab father ampl circumstanti evid good citizen could stand need justifi vote most juri member want get decis done hastili person errand mind game want watch peopl prefer see and hot day hotair condit option under condit fonda ask much fellow juror ask put asid thier usual concern schedul demand dislodg mani year easi prejudic corrod judgment plead take time tri reconstruct peopl point view someth men clearli dont make habit it poignant toward conclus men leav courthous one man admiringli ask fonda name they exhang surnam part realiz either theyr incap small talk moment moral experienceor perhap noth common theyv emerg light day i dont think lumet view polit filmmak truli angri men film debut astonish accomplish but think mani subsequ film documentari martin luther king journey serpico chart crusad copi compel question entrench system wasnt work well pawnbrok anoth power film concentr camp survivor tri avoid deal moral complic outsid world he back dog day afternoon charact fed enough money human respons pull the protagonist film peopl confront confront system discrimin racial econom and noth polit examin tyranni it brave bodi work one admir angri men great place start,Positive

Juror 8 is portrayed as a champion of justice, but his methods of jury tampering by introducing an identical knife and speculating on witness testimonies, steps beyond courtroom protocols. He dismisses the old man's account and makes assumptions about the female witness's eyesight all based on personal experiments and conjecture, not verified evidence.

Juror 8's tactics and amateur detective work, created bias on the jury with emotional appeals rather than sticking to the trial facts, and undermining the judicial process.

"Yep this movie is so great. The tension of the characters draws the audience in from the start. We imagine that the case is open and shut, 11 me saying guilty and 1 not. We feel the discomfort of Henry Fonda as the other characters belittle and mock how he can see any reasonable doubt in the case. But we also share his victories and the enthusiasm as he proceeds to refute or add doubt to the arguments for guilty and are captivated and draw in as other jurors begin to see doubt in the proceedings.

The audience can also see the arguments for guilty and wonder if Fonda's character is correct in saying that he doubts. Yet they also feel the shame of the characters as he disproves that a previously sound theory is iron tight, joining his side as members of the jury do.

On top of this they are wonderfully woven in human elements such as the misconceptions that influence people and the growing tension between different characters. This is brought to life even more by the amazing performances, Fonda, Lee J Cobb and Joseph Sweeney are of particular note.

Knows very well how to create tension in the necessary moments and later finish with plot twists. But the best thing about the film is the way it builds a world so real, so authentic to affirm that the characters are completely human, there is no hero or villain; There are no implausible situations that could only exist within a movie, thus doing the magnificent job of wrapping us in their world like no other movie.",in year film industri forc massiv millionair product creat film i could say almost perfect no simpli perfect would count finger one hand the script import thing point view plu narr and movi squeez maximum potenti know take break delv charact explain act like know well creat tension necessari moment later finish plot twist but best thing film way build world real authent affirm charact complet human hero villain there implaus situat could exist within movi thu magnific job wrap u world like movi,Positive

"In the overheated jury room of the New York County Courthouse, a jury prepares to deliberate the case of an 18-year-old impoverished youth accused of stabbing his father to death. The judge instructs them that if there is any reasonable doubt, the jurors are to return a verdict of not guilty. If found guilty, the defendant will receive a death sentence. The verdict must be unanimous. The evidence at first seems convincing. A neighbor testified to witnessing the defendant stab his father from her window. Another neighbor testified that he heard the defendant threaten to kill his father and the father's body hitting the ground, and then, through his peephole, saw the defendant run past his door. The boy has a violent past and had recently purchased a switchblade of the same type as was found at the murder scene, but claimed he lost his. The knife at the scene had been cleaned of fingerprints. In a preliminary vote, all jurors vote guilty except Juror 8, who believes that there should be some discussion before the verdict is made. He questions the reliability of the witnesses. Producing his own switchblade, he throws doubt on the supposed uniqueness of the murder weapon. He says he cannot vote guilty because reasonable doubt exists. Juror 8 suggests a secret ballot, from which he will abstain; if all the other jurors still vote guilty, he will acquiesce. The ballot reveals one not guilty vote. Juror 9 reveals that he changed his vote, agreeing there should be more discussion. Juror 8 argues that the noise of a passing train would have obscured the threat the second witness claimed to have overheard. Juror 5 changes his vote, as does Juror 11, who believes the defendant, had he truly killed his father, would not have returned to the crime scene several hours later to retrieve the murder weapon as it had already been cleaned of fingerprints. Juror 8 points out that people often say ""I'm going to kill you"" without literally meaning it. Jurors 5, 6, and 8 further question the second witness's story. Juror 3 is infuriated, and after a verbal argument, tries to attack Juror 8, shouting ""I'll kill him!"". Juror 8 points out that this proves his point about the defendant's words. Jurors 2 and 6 change their votes; the jury is now evenly split. Juror 4 doubts the defendant's alibi, based on the boy's inability to recall certain details. Juror 8 tests Juror 4's own memory. He is able to remember events from the previous week, with some difficulty. Jurors 2, 3, and 8 debate whether the defendant could have stabbed his much-taller father from a downward angle, eventually deciding it was physically possible, though awkward. Juror 5 points out that someone who knew how to use a switchblade would have stabbed underhand at an upwards angle. Impatient to leave, Juror 7 changes his vote and is confronted by Juror 11; Juror 7 insists, albeit unconvincingly, that he thinks the defendant is not guilty. Jurors 1 and 12 also change their votes, leaving only three guilty votes. Juror 10 erupts in racially motivated vitriol. The rest of the jurors turn their backs to him and Juror 4 tells him to sit down and be quiet. Juror 4 declares that the woman who saw the killing from across the street stands as solid evidence. Juror 12 reverts back to a guilty vote. Juror 9 realizes that the witness, coming from bed, would not have had time to put on her glasses in time to see the assault occur, making her story dubious. The remaining jurors, except Juror 3, change their vote to not guilty. Juror 3 gives an increasingly tortured string of arguments, building on earlier remarks about his strained relationship with his own son. In a moment of rage, Juror 3 tears up a photograph of him and his son before breaking down sobbing. He mutters not guilty, making the vote unanimous. As the others leave, Juror 8 helps the distraught Juror 3 with his coat. The defendant is found not guilty off-screen and the jurors leave the courthouse. In a brief epilogue, Jurors 8 and 9 introduce each other for the first time by their names before parting.",in overh juri room new york counti courthous juri prepar deliber case yearold impoverish youth accus stab father death the judg instruct reason doubt juror return verdict guilti if found guilti defend receiv death sentenc the verdict must unanim the evid first seem convinc a neighbor testifi wit defend stab father window anoth neighbor testifi heard defend threaten kill father father bodi hit ground peephol saw defend run past door the boy violent past recent purchas switchblad type found murder scene claim lost the knife scene clean fingerprint in preliminari vote juror vote guilti except juror believ discus verdict made he question reliabl wit produc switchblad throw doubt suppos uniqu murder weapon he say cannot vote guilti reason doubt exist juror suggest secret ballot abstain juror still vote guilti acquiesc the ballot reveal one guilti vote juror reveal chang vote agre discus juror argu nois pas train would obscur threat second wit claim overheard juror chang vote juror believ defend truli kill father would return crime scene sever hour later retriev murder weapon alreadi clean fingerprint juror point peopl often say im go kill without liter mean juror question second witness stori juror infuri verbal argument tri attack juror shout ill kill juror point prove point defend word juror chang vote juri evenli split juror doubt defend alibi base boy inabl recal certain detail juror test juror memori he abl rememb event previou week difficulti juror debat whether defend could stab muchtal father downward angl eventu decid physic possibl though awkward juror point someon knew use switchblad would stab underhand upward angl impati leav juror chang vote confront juror juror insist albeit unconvincingli think defend guilti juror also chang vote leav three guilti vote juror erupt racial motiv vitriol the rest juror turn back juror tell sit quiet juror declar woman saw kill across street stand solid evid juror revert back guilti vote juror realiz wit come bed would time put glass time see assault occur make stori dubiou the remain juror except juror chang vote guilti juror give increasingli tortur string argument build earlier remark strain relationship son in moment rage juror tear photograph son break sob he mutter guilti make vote unanim a other leav juror help distraught juror coat the defend found guilti offscreen juror leav courthous in brief epilogu juror introduc first time name part,Neutral

"This is one of the greatest movies not only of the 1950s, but of all time. What makes it unique are the direction, the actors' performances, the cinematography and the set. In my opinion, whoever loves classic movies or movies in general should watch this movie at least once in a lifetime - it's that great and perfect! This movie should be even shown in film schools as a textbook example of how to make a movie without special effects but only with a good script and talented actors. That's it: a movie shot in black and white and for almost all the time the film is set in a small room.

The direction (by Sidney Lumet in his debut) is top-notch and the actors' performances are all career-bests. Henry Fonda has never given a better performance than the one he gives in this movie, and all the other actors - Jack Warden, Jack Klugman, Robert Webber, Lee J. Cobb, Martin Balsam, John Fiedler for naming a few - who were still unknown at the time, are great here and give great support to Fonda.

"A courtroom drama which spends about a minute inside an actual courtroom, ""12 Angry Men"" defies expectations in other ways, too, most particularly by not being a star vehicle despite starring Henry Fonda.

It's a bit of a Trojan Horse, too; screenwriter Reginald Rose making his case against the death penalty by showing a kid who appears guilty of having stabbed his father in a moment of rage and encouraging us to root for jury nullification, a la OJ, because he shouldn't have to die for his crime. If the charge wasn't first-degree murder and execution not concomitant with a guilty verdict, we might see the pesky Mr. Davis (Fonda) and his tireless ""supposing"" not much differently than does angry Juror #3 (Lee J. Cobb).

""It's now your duty to sit down and try and separate the facts from the fancy,"" a supremely bored judge tells the jury at the start of the movie.

But a lot of ""fancy"" gets tossed around in the jury room, not just ethnic slurs from Juror #10 (Ed Begley) and baseball chatter from Juror #7 (Jack Warden), two solid early votes for conviction. Much of the fancy comes from Davis himself, who asks the other jurors to accept an odd set of coincidences and aspersions in order to ignore the stubborn fact that someone walked into a man's apartment and stabbed him to death with the same kind of switchblade that had belonged to his angry son.

""This kid's been kicked around all his life,"" Davis says. ""He's had a pretty miserable 18 years. I think we owe him a few words.""

Does anyone really believe this should work? Well, in ""12 Angry Men"" it does, aided by Rose's clever manipulation, Sidney Lumet's seamless but unshowy directing, and a performance by Fonda that demonstrates his egoless mastery of the screen acting craft at its near-height. The supporting cast is great, too, even the underdiscussed ones like Ed Binns' salt-of-the-earth painter #6 and Robert Webber's marketing whizkid #12, who apparently invents Rice Krispies before our very eyes.

The script does have its weak moments, none worse than when #10 goes off on his unfortunate diatribe regarding ""them"", in which all but two of his fellows leave their seats and symbolically turn away from him. A Richard Thomas stage production I saw handled this awkward business more cleverly. The music is a collection of ugly off-notes, and much of the background chatter is unconvincing.

""12 Angry Men"" does have terrific setwork and piercing character moments, like how stuffy stockbroker #4 (E.G. Marshall) sniffily ignores #3's attempt to hand him a business card. Cobb as #3 is stuck with the most over-the-top moments, but sells them well. Cobb could yell with the best of them, and proves it here.

But ""12 Angry Men"", while a good movie, is not great film, pushing a dubious rooting interest for a killer's freedom. Maybe he doesn't deserve to die, but ""12 Angry Men"" stacks the deck too much in his favor to be called high art.",a courtroom drama spend minut insid actual courtroom angri men defi expect way particularli star vehicl despit star henri fonda it bit trojan hors screenwrit reginald rose make case death penalti show kid appear guilti stab father moment rage encourag u root juri nullif la oj shouldnt die crime if charg wasnt firstdegre murder execut concomit guilti verdict might see peski mr davi fonda tireless suppos much differ angri juror lee j cobb it duti sit tri separ fact fanci suprem bore judg tell juri start movi but lot fanci get toss around juri room ethnic slur juror ed begley basebal chatter juror jack warden two solid earli vote convict much fanci come davi ask juror accept odd set coincid asper order ignor stubborn fact someon walk man apart stab death kind switchblad belong angri son thi kid kick around life davi say he pretti miser year i think owe word doe anyon realli believ work well angri men aid rose clever manipul sidney lumet seamless unshowi direct perform fonda demonstr egoless masteri screen act craft nearheight the support cast great even underdiscuss one like ed binn saltoftheearth painter robert webber market whizkid appar invent rice krispi eye the script weak moment none wors goe unfortun diatrib regard two fellow leav seat symbol turn away a richard thoma stage product i saw handl awkward busi cleverli the music collect ugli offnot much background chatter unconvinc angri men terrif setwork pierc charact moment like stuffi stockbrok eg marshal sniffili ignor attempt hand busi card cobb stuck overthetop moment sell well cobb could yell best prove but angri men good movi great film push dubiou root interest killer freedom mayb doesnt deserv die angri men stack deck much favor call high art,Positive

"Sidney Lumet's ""12 Angry Men"" (1957) has me laughing out-loud every time I see it. This is not because I dislike the film, but because the director makes it seem so easily done, it makes you think you could do it yourself. The acting is a complete dream. Henry Fonda, E. G. Marshall, Martin Balsam and Robert Webber are exceptional. But the real star of the film is Lee J. Cobb. He immense's himself so completely into his role that its hard to believe that the movie isn't a documentary. The ending of the film, with that look on Lee J. Cobb's face is heart rendering. Lumet's directorial debut (he had been previously in TV) is as remarkable as Orson Welle's in ""Citizen Kane"".

"Eighth grade was my first exposure to 12 Angry Men. My class was reading it as a play, I read the lines of juror number eleven. Shortly after the conclusion of our class read, we watched the film adaptation. I was in eighth grade, I knew it was a great film, but I didn't understand the brilliance of it that I see today. 12 Angry Men's greatest creative strength is the direction- technically. Sidney Lumet has every shot in every scene fitting together creating an effortless flow for the film. However, the greatest weakness the picture has is its hard for the viewer to really settle their inner roots in the it for some reason. The directing doesn't transport our emotions until the second half of the film.

The Good Wife produced en episode in their first season titled Doubt. In a show that studies a defense attorney's efforts to create doubt in a jury's mind, the process of the jury members consolations are shown. I thought it was a brilliant move and we should see more media centric things about juries. That episode glimmers with inspiration from 12 Angry Men, but it lacks the morality, mystery, and humanity found in the play. People mistake character development for spending mass amounts of time with a particular character. I believe character development is to I understand a character, the writing and actor thoroughly explain the person on the page to me. 12 Angry Men develops twelve characters in ninety minutes without even knowing their names.

As each juror slowly changes their verdict in 12 Angry Men, near the middle of the film I was struck, seeing a metaphor occurring mid-film. It all goes back to politics, the jurors willing to believe that the boy on trial is innocent are the liberals and the men who close their mind to any possibility of innocence represent the conservative party. The jurors who may have been judged for the way they talk, what ethnicity they are, their sexual orientation, or if they were just plain old sensitive were the ones who opened their minds up to Juror 7's campaign to examine the case thoroughly. Now 12 Angry Men still lives back in the days where life was religion-centric and things were one way, and one way one only. This is a move that makes 12 Angry Men ahead of its time.

12 Angry Men is a slice to how a jury actually acts to some extent. The thing they always forget, when their minds are clouded with things in their life they are missing due to their obligation to the justice system, is they hold the fate of another man's life. It's not something that can be taken lightly. Reasonable doubt is mistaken with something that proves the accused not guilty. That's not true and 12 Angry Men shines a light on that discussion. What this film is about to me is the laziness, selfishness, and our personal bias hiding our judgment. We all need to take a step back sometimes and really look at the situation for the gray, not black or white. Even laughing here and there, 12 Angry Men is something that may not be the most fun film to watch, but it's certainly an important to see.

"I kind of feel like i'm in no position to judge this film, because that is what a review is after all, judgment. The reason i feel unworthy of reviewing this picture is because it is one of the best films ever made and i can not say that about too many films. This film is a study on the nature of man and all of what he thinks. It's a study on why we take action about pretty much anything. Beneath all the convincing and lecturing, the main character shows more than that: the psychology of the masses, the prejudice and it's roots, the mixed feelings of thinking that you're doing good even when not sure if you are and so many more. I don't really want to get in to the story of the film, not only because the film offers a quick and grabbing pull into it's universe, but also for not wanting to ruin the experience of meeting the cosmos that Sidney Lumet orchestrated for the audience.

"12 Angry men is a film in which maybe those over 25 would enjoy. It explores prejudices and preconceived notions which people had in the 1950s. Actors such as Henry Fonda, Lee J.

Without these good performances, it could have been a boring movie with meaningless discussions in the jury room and in the court room. These talented actors bring life to the movies.

I was pleasantly surprised that a movie with no action at all, no mind-bending plot, and what could seem like a very boring setting, could have me so invested and on the edge of my seat. The film flows perfectly and makes you feel as if you are there, like you are Juror #13 trying to come up with arguments to convince everyone else. One thing I liked a lot is that every juror has a strictly unique personality, and can only be convinced in a specific way. But what puts that movie up there for me is that you never know if the kid was or wasn't guilty. Throughout the movie, Juror #8 remarks that it is possible to be right or wrong, and with the information they have, nothing can be taken for granted. It ultimately comes to what is morally correct, having an innocent kid killed or letting a murderer out in the streets. It makes you realize how easily can people, who have nothing to win or lose, go over important details when there's a lot at stake.

"This film is so impactful and evocative to me. The entire journey is just so riveting and masterful. Even though it was made in the 1950s you can easily apply this film to today's society as its overall message and values it conveys to the audience, such as prejudice and how everyone will interpret a situation differently. I love the cinematography in this film especially the opening scene as the credits are rolling as it is one take and it just adds to show us the claustrophobia these men must be feeling as they are all cramped together in a small hot room for hours. The performance these actors give are impeccable and layer on top of each others to increase the tension.

"Old movies probably don't get the kind of respect that they should. There was a time when being an actor was more than just a sign you were wealthy, it was a sign you were talented as hell. The whole cast in this movie is nothing short of amazing. Between that and a great story, 12 angry men although made in 1957 is just as culturally relevant and important today as it was back then.

The story finds 12 nameless jurors(at least until the end anyway) deliberating over a boy who is supposedly guilty as hell over the murder of his own father. Suffice to say, almost all 12 men(remember, this was the 1950's) want to convict this boy. The lone holdout wants to go over the evidence a little more because something inside him says maybe it's worth it because they're deciding a boy's fate, and that it's not something to be so casual about.

The ensuing two hours of the film features some great twists, great turns, and remarkable humanity on display by all these wonderful actors, portraying very flawed but very relatable human beings. In the end, what really makes this movie works is that 12 men understood what responsibility truly means... so I guess this is kind of like Spiderman... times 12.

All jokes aside, 12 Angry Men is a classic and is worthy of being shown at film schools not just because it demonstrates compelling acting, great story, amazing emotion and even character growth... by most of the main cast.

"Good legal drama but the evidence brought to our attention by juror no. 8 (Henry Fonda) is often not especially convincing but seems to be taken very seriously by progressively more and more men in the room until inevitably we have a unanimous Not Guilty verdict. An example of this, is when Fonda successfully gets the others to acknowledge that the old man witness is unreliable, yet then goes on to base a major part of his own evidence on the old fellows testimony that he took fifteen seconds to get to the door to witness the murderer fleeing. Fonda clearly assumes that this man he has determined as unreliable would get his exact timings spot on in a moment of heightened emotion. It may seem like a minor point but there are just a little too many of these small inconsistent assumptions littering 12 Angry Men for me to feel it was an entirely successful exercise. I really couldn't help shake the notion that Fonda's character had his own agenda and was simply unwilling to back down. Perhaps he was the most persuasive man in the room and that was ultimately the reason that the decision was made. It's difficult to really say with any certainty that the accused was innocent at all.

Then I stumble upon this title '12 Angry Men' I didn't think of it as much so I thought I will just give it a try.

"A black-and-white film released in 1957, 12 Angry Men was nevertheless one that can captivate its modern audience despite the fact that the entirety of the film was practically shot in a Jury room and consisted of just dialogues. Yet, it may be precisely on this ground that it was able to illustrate clearly to the audience the importance of overcoming our implicit prejudices to arrive at a successful negotiation. Without dictating any Jurors to take up an extreme 'bad guy' role (these are characters and personalities that we often see in our everyday lives), the film further attempts to draw parallels from the Jury room to the real world through urging us to reflect on our prejudices as we go through the hum-drums of our everyday lives.",a blackandwhit film releas angri men nevertheless one captiv modern audienc despit fact entireti film practic shot juri room consist dialogu yet may precis ground abl illustr clearli audienc import overcom implicit prejudic arriv success negoti without dictat juror take extrem bad guy role charact person often see everyday live film attempt draw parallel juri room real world urg u reflect prejudic go humdrum everyday live,Negative

"I guess the message of this movie is timeless, especially in the modern world, in this modern times. So I am republishing it. For all the Journalism and Mass Comm student, no make it, for everyone who is with even a little but of a democratic mind set, this movie is a must watch.

I was doing a case study in my Mass-Communication class, when I came upon an old 1957 movie named ""12 angry men"". Who would have thought that a monochromatic film about a Spanish boy accused of murder, and the dilemma of the Jury could be such an experience? ""12 angry men"" was such a lucid, tense, and strangely realistic thriller.

The story is pretty contrived - during a murder trial, one man's (Henry Fonda) doubts about the accused's guilt gradually overcome the rather less-than-democratic prejudices of the other eleven members of the jury. While the film itself points out that democracy and all its human participants are flawed in nature, it upholds the values of democracy, probably in a way which is very much apt to the time. The jurors were named after numbers, very much in sync with ideal democracy, and the photography, being black and white, heightens the tension.

Taking place in almost entirely a jury room, the film was very economical, 12 angry men watches as 11 jurors, convinced of the boys guilt, are slowly won over by one man sympathetic enough to at least looking into the matter, and having reasonable doubts before sending a man to die..the tagline of the movie sums it up...""life in their hands, death on their minds"". The screenplay, happening almost entirely in a single room, in a hot summer afternoon, adds on to the claustrophobia, and rather being confining and acts as a tension and drama building measure.

The film leaves a tremendous impact, and leaves a person wondering, about the inevitability as well as the futility of democracy.

"In the movie, 12 jurors were faced with a grave situation, which was to decide whether an 18-year-old should be found guilty of murder and given the death penalty. By watching their struggles in forming consensus, it shone light on the process of negotiations. The movie, primarily driven by the emotions of the jurors exhibit characteristics that impede the course of negotiations. Be it for dramatic effect, the jurors seem to have difficulties separating people from the problem on several occasions, with their emotions overwhelming them. The acting in 12 angry men is terrific, with the men portraying the true and loaded emotions that occur when there are disagreements. There are many lessons to be learnt from the negotiations process. For instance, Juror 10's underlying prejudice and preconceived notions can be observed when he said that slums were breeding grounds for criminals and were 'dirty'. Disapproval of his prejudiced views was clear as the other jurors turned their backs against him and disregarded his opinions, reminding him not to let it cloud his judgement. The movie is a true rleflection of what negotiations could be like in real-world scenarios, and it is important for us to take away some valuable skills from it",in movi juror face grave situat decid whether yearold found guilti murder given death penalti by watch struggl form consensu shone light process negoti the movi primarili driven emot juror exhibit characterist imped cours negoti be dramat effect juror seem difficulti separ peopl problem sever occas emot overwhelm the act angri men terrif men portray true load emot occur disagr there mani lesson learnt negoti process for instanc juror underli prejudic preconceiv notion observ said slum breed ground crimin dirti disapprov prejud view clear juror turn back disregard opinion remind let cloud judgement the movi true rleflect negoti could like realworld scenario import u take away valuabl skill,Neutral

"I will not go in normal review of the movie. It had been brilliant. There were loopholes, but not in the plot, but in the prosecution. There are more than reasonable doubt of the boy being not guilty and he most certainly was, along with the points made by the defense (jurors) there were several other missed points, which the stories said, but weren't used for defense. The movie brilliantly brings out, when the cops wants to make a scapegoat of someone who doesn't have means to defend, how easily they can. The defense lawyer, as mentioned during discussions, was an unwilling completely disinterested and somehow wanted to go over the ordeal. Probably a case of 'Court Appointed' - a la ""You volunteer"" of An Officer And A gentleman. The glaring inconsistencies, which the juror noticed, and some they didn't were not noticed by him. However that isn't the brilliance of the movie, but it is its real life depiction of a upper echelon policy meeting, especially Board Meetings of a company. I am in a position vouch for that. Probably, if not already, this movie should be a part of mandatory curriculum of any business school. There the CEO has brought an agenda, ably supported by his/her team (the prosecutors). It is in Board, and usually the way it happens, all are very convinced of the power point presentation and the golden future the schemes will lead to. Unless one has a doubt and express it, the scheme will move on, till probably it is too late (boy past and beyond chair).

It is only when one says ""I am not too sure"" the discussions take place and various lacunae and wrong assumptions come to surface. In business, those are taken (sometimes) positively to plug the loopholes and polish the proposal (here of course there were no midway) but still the dynamics of a business meeting was replicated. The members with their own personal opinions (back grounds, prejudices), changing courts, on one side and again on other side, as the respective prejudices were addressed by the two opposing camps. Though all the background of each were not clearly brought out, but still one could guess, from their prejudices. Change the topic, and as I said it is a board meet.

On the lighter side. this movie is strangely devoid of feminine presence. In the whole movie, leave aside jurors, there are not a single member of the fair gender credited or un-credited. In fact only two women ever get referred to, first being one of the star witnesses and the other one of the juror's wife.",i go normal review movi it brilliant there loophol plot prosecut there reason doubt boy guilti certainli along point made defens juror sever miss point stori said werent use defens the movi brilliantli bring cop want make scapegoat someon doesnt mean defend easili the defens lawyer mention discus unwil complet disinterest somehow want go ordeal probabl case court appoint la you volunt an offic and a gentleman the glare inconsist juror notic didnt notic howev isnt brillianc movi real life depict upper echelon polici meet especi board meet compani i posit vouch probabl alreadi movi part mandatori curriculum busi school there ceo brought agenda abli support hisher team prosecutor it board usual way happen convinc power point present golden futur scheme lead unless one doubt express scheme move till probabl late boy past beyond chair it one say i sure discus take place variou lacuna wrong assumpt come surfac in busi taken sometim posit plug loophol polish propos cours midway still dynam busi meet replic the member person opinion back ground prejudic chang court one side side respect prejudic address two oppos camp though background clearli brought still one could guess prejudic chang topic i said board meet on lighter side movi strang devoid feminin presenc in whole movi leav asid juror singl member fair gender credit uncredit in fact two woman ever get refer first one star wit one juror wife,Neutral

"""12 Angry Men,"" directed by Sidney Lumet and released in 1957, is a timeless courtroom drama that transcends its genre to explore profound themes of justice, prejudice, and the moral responsibilities of a jury. Set almost entirely within a single room, the film unfolds as twelve jurors deliberate the fate of a young defendant accused of murder. What begins as a seemingly straightforward case quickly evolves into a gripping exploration of bias, doubt, and human integrity.

The film's strength lies in its exceptional writing and directing. Reginald Rose's script masterfully navigates the intense dynamics within the jury, illuminating how personal experiences, emotions, and prejudices can cloud judgment. Each juror is richly characterized, with distinct personalities and backgrounds that shape their perspectives on the case.

Henry Fonda, who plays Juror #8, stands out as the lone voice advocating for reasonable doubt. His performance is both poignant and resolute, embodying the ideal of justice through his unwavering commitment to truth. Fonda's character serves as a moral compass throughout the film, challenging the other jurors to confront their biases and reconsider the evidence presented.

The ensemble cast features remarkable performances from actors like Lee J. Cobb, Ed Begley, and Jack Klugman, each bringing depth to their characters. As tensions rise and tempers flare, the claustrophobic setting of the jury room creates an atmosphere of palpable tension, expertly captured by Lumet's direction. The film's cinematography, with its clever use of close-ups and varying angles, enhances the emotional stakes and keeps viewers engrossed.

""12 Angry Men"" not only serves as a gripping narrative but also acts as a profound social commentary. The film highlights the fragility of the justice system and the importance of civic duty. It poses critical questions regarding the nature of guilt and innocence, the impact of socio-economic backgrounds, and the significance of empathy in decision-making.

Despite being over six decades old, ""12 Angry Men"" remains remarkably relevant, as the issues it tackles-prejudice, accountability, and the morality of judgment-continue to resonate in contemporary society. It invites audiences to engage in introspection while examining their own biases and the importance of standing up for what is right.

""12 Angry Men"" is a cinematic masterpiece that combines brilliant writing, stellar performances, and a compelling narrative to create a thought-provoking experience. Its exploration of justice and human nature is as relevant today as it was at its release, making it a must-see film for anyone interested in the complexities of morality and the ethical dilemmas faced within the justice system.

"This is regarded as one of the best films ever made and I see why.

12 Angry Men is about a jury of twelve men who decide whether a boy is guilty of a murder or not. Everyone finds him guilty except for Juror 8 who believes there's reasonable doubt leading the rest of the jury to question their decisions.

By the end of its 96 minute runtime, I was completely blown away. For a film so limited in scale, I couldn't believe how suspenseful and incredible this film was. The majority of this film takes place in one room and it's masterful how well made it is. As the opening credits roll, Sidney Lumet tracks the camera in one single take, introducing us to every character and helping us get a first impression of what they're like. It's an outstanding beginning that establishes Lumet's talent. Lumet makes use of the one location to its full potential. The way some scenes are shot and edited make for some extremely tension filled moments that managed to surprise me in every way. There is not a single dull moment. As it progresses, the suspense goes up a notch leaving my eyes glued to the screen for its entirety. It's especially impressive considering this was Lumet's feature film debut. Could you get a better debut than this?!

For a film taking place in one room, a lot of dialogue is thrown around in what I consider to be one of the best scripts to ever be written. Reginald Rose's script astounds me. Not only am I dazzled by the way Rose unfolds this case but also how much it revealed certain details about the characters. He's very smart in framing the opinions of each of the men and why they have that opinion, leading to some emotionally powerful scenes that disclose reasons as to why some members think the boy is guilty excluding the evidence presented. This is a script that writers will dream of writing and I have to praise Reginald Rose for achieving this feat. Aside from the script and direction, the performances is the icing on the cake. Every single person puts their best foot forward and delivers incredible performances. Henry Fonda stands out as Juror 8 and is extremely compelling to watch. Lee J. Cobb is another standout who gets better and better as the film continues. Bit by bit, we learn how troubled of a person he is and Cobb steals the show during those intense scenes.

I now see why 12 Angry Men is loved so much. This is a film and ensemble piece that has it all. It's outstanding on every single level whether it's the performances, the script or the direction. This is a work of art that should be watched by everyone!",thi regard one best film ever made i see angri men juri twelv men decid whether boy guilti murder everyon find guilti except juror believ there reason doubt lead rest juri question decis by end minut runtim i complet blown away for film limit scale i couldnt believ suspens incred film the major film take place one room master well made a open credit roll sidney lumet track camera one singl take introduc u everi charact help u get first impress theyr like it outstand begin establish lumet talent lumet make use one locat full potenti the way scene shot edit make extrem tension fill moment manag surpris everi way there singl dull moment a progress suspens goe notch leav eye glu screen entireti it especi impress consid lumet featur film debut could get better debut for film take place one room lot dialogu thrown around i consid one best script ever written reginald rose script astound not i dazzl way rose unfold case also much reveal certain detail charact he smart frame opinion men opinion lead emot power scene disclos reason member think boy guilti exclud evid present thi script writer dream write i prais reginald rose achiev feat asid script direct perform ice cake everi singl person put best foot forward deliv incred perform henri fonda stand juror extrem compel watch lee j cobb anoth standout get better better film continu bit bit learn troubl person cobb steal show intens scene i see angri men love much thi film ensembl piec it outstand everi singl level whether perform script direct thi work art watch everyon,Positive

"As a directional debut, you could do worse than Sidney Lumet's excellent '12 Angry Men'. It would be the beginning of an illustrious career, even though perhaps the heights of his debut would never quite be reached again.

12 Angry Men is, apart from several opening shots, closing shots and a couple of scenes in a side room, filmed completely in one single room. To create a fascinating, character driven & tension filled picture can be quite difficult for some directors with this knowledge, but Lumet's direction here is world class. He uses the single location to enhance the feeling of claustrophobia, which also enhances a feeling of tension as all characters grow angrier as the film progresses. Much has been said about Lumet's use of camera angles to enhance the mood in our characters, such as the fact that the camera is generally placed at higher angles during the first act of the film, and gradually seems to be placed lower and lower towards the end, as more people are convinced of the 'not guilty' vote, so the camera emphasizes their superiority over the 'guilty' voters. Even though the film is largely in a single room, Lumet also uses weather conditions as a mood setter, with the setting being in a heatwave of some kind, and when the tables start turning towards the end in terms of the votes, the weather switches to pouring rain, which is generally an even larger symbolism of 'chaos', and that is precisely what is going on during the final moments of this picture.

12 Angry Men is also undoubtedly one of the best acted films in cinematic history, with in particular Lee J. Cobb giving the performance of a lifetime. This is not just an angry character, thriving on nihilistic thoughts and hating on everything that happens, but a tragic character that is prejudiced due to his strained relationship with his own son. This brings forth another point, which are ofcourse all twelve characters. All of these characters have some kind of background, origin, and all of them behave very differently and according to their personal lives and experiences. An opening shot of the room featuring all of the jurors entering and bantering with eachother already gives the audience an idea as to what kind of people these jurors are. All the while Lumet uses very long takes, switching between mid-shots & wide-shots in single takes to create the most immersive and personal experience possible. Later in the film, when things start to heat up even more, he also induces a fantastic use of the close-up, which is ofcourse generally the most personal and direct of shot compositions.

Furthermore, the screenplay by Reginald Rose is also a phenomenal addition to this film, as every single line of dialogue, character building and general confrontations enhance the tension significantly. Ofcourse, we do not get to witness extraordinary production design or scale due to the simplistic setting, but it is hard to imagine what Lumet could have done even better considering the material he was given.

Due to Lumet's technical expertise, visual mood setters, claustrophic atmosphere & the fantastic energetic acting, it feels as a 'thriller' in a drama setting. Ofcourse the fact that the audience does not know anything about the case beforehand also helps, since the viewer will be even more compelled to follow the discussions used in this picture, because we do not know anything about the case yet. In the end, whether or not the kid is guilty is shown to be quite irrelevant, as this film is mainly a message about the interference of personal prejudice in terms of law.

"12 Angry Men is a very entertaining film. It is full of great writing, directing, cinematography, and acting! Henry Fonda proves to be a very strong leading man. His performance here is flawless as a man trying to convince 11 other jurors about the possibility of a man's innocence. Lee J. Cobb is phenomenal, as well as E.G. Marshall. The twists and turns the film goes though are very absorbing, and when the film is done, you feel like you know every one of these characters very well. Sidney Lumet is a very talented director, he captures some very nice shots, and some very long shots that are powerful. 12 Angry Men is one of those rare black-and-white films that are actually very entertaining.",angri men entertain film it full great write direct cinematographi act henri fonda prove strong lead man hi perform flawless man tri convinc juror possibl man innoc lee j cobb phenomen well eg marshal the twist turn film goe though absorb film done feel like know everi one charact well sidney lumet talent director captur nice shot long shot power angri men one rare blackandwhit film actual entertain,Positive
"As a team of film critics, we recently went to the cinema to see a broadcast of the movie ""12 angry men"" and God, what a great film for octogenarians! Maybe to give you our opinion about it, we must put this dud into context.

12 angry men or ""12 hommes en colère"" in French, is a 1957 American courtroom drama film directed by Sidney Lumet and based on the eponymous piece of theatre of 1954 written by Reginald Rose. As Lumet is a filmmaker known for his tragedies and critics of American justice system, we were, as fans waiting for a harrowing masterpiece! But we think that our small introduction made you understand that we were disappointed.

The movie unfolds in a jury room in which 12 jurors are deliberating the case of an impoverished 18-year-old boy who is accused of stabbing his father to death. Therefore, the spectator follows this uneven trial for not less than ninety-six minutes, which is of course a bit exhausting. However, you may be pleased when seeing the cast with Henry Fonda, which would be normal. Yet, he probably is the reason of the movie's recognition, because there is nothing else that distinguishes it from other courtroom films such as Liar Liar from 1997. Maybe, we are scandalmongers because you probably know Martin Balsam? Or John Fiedler? No, you don't? To be honest we think that Fonda, Mr Davis in the movie, or the juror eight truly makes the film. If the gamechanger, the one who was about to save the young boy by rebelling against the tyranny of the majority, was anonymous for the spectators, would people give the movie that much attention? We do not think so. Nevertheless, the themes addressed in this film seemed intrusting: the justice and the question of morality and values are omnipresent, but they would be the few positive points. In fact, it contains an underlying message about prejudicial actions, the difficulties to be a juror and even racism during the fifties. It provides an interesting perspective on the importance of being a juror and the possible biases that jurors could, and still can encounter nowadays. It is both dramatic and tense, and it is insightful in its depiction of various aspects of humanity. But we were unable to identify with this film as it was impossible to identify with any of the jurors, it felt like they were not communicating any emotion.

Moreover, the script may seem ingenious but if you dig a bit it is not really the case and almost becomes boring at one point. It was so hard not to fall asleep while watching it. We were neither surprised nor excited to see the film and after we saw it. Don't you think the story is a bit far-fetched? Twelve brains take ninety minutes to agree on such an obvious case? Of course, he was not guilty. But after all, this movie kind of shows how screwed up the American justice system is. The poor boy is found guilty before all the evidence were even considered. Logic would dictate that he is not guilty until proven innocent, but apparently only one brain managed to take that detail into account, which made the scenario a bit inconceivable.

To be the most objective as possible, 12 angry men is one of the films that did not aged well. Overall, this is a good movie if you like vintage (because it is trending again), slow-paced, and closed-door films. You can also go see it if you like films that denounce timeless issues that still occur today. Also, if you like Henry Fonda, you want to watch it because he still plays greatly. It can be a great old school classic, but definitely a waste of time for people, like us from Generation Z. If you are into more dynamic courtroom movies, we would advice you to watch more recent ones, such as ""Just mercy"" from 2019 or ""the Trial of the Chicago 7"" that was released last year!",a team film critic recent went cinema see broadcast movi angri men god great film octogenarian mayb give opinion must put dud context angri men homm en colèr french american courtroom drama film direct sidney lumet base eponym piec theatr written reginald rose a lumet filmmak known tragedi critic american justic system fan wait harrow masterpiec but think small introduct made understand disappoint the movi unfold juri room juror deliber case impoverish yearold boy accus stab father death therefor spectat follow uneven trial less ninetysix minut cours bit exhaust howev may plea see cast henri fonda would normal yet probabl reason movi recognit noth el distinguish courtroom film liar liar mayb scandalmong probabl know martin balsam or john fiedler no dont to honest think fonda mr davi movi juror eight truli make film if gamechang one save young boy rebel tyranni major anonym spectat would peopl give movi much attent we think nevertheless theme address film seem intrust justic question moral valu omnipres would posit point in fact contain underli messag prejudici action difficulti juror even racism fifti it provid interest perspect import juror possibl bias juror could still encount nowaday it dramat ten insight depict variou aspect human but unabl identifi film imposs identifi juror felt like commun emot moreov script may seem ingeni dig bit realli case almost becom bore one point it hard fall asleep watch we neither surpris excit see film saw dont think stori bit farfetch twelv brain take nineti minut agre obviou case of cours guilti but movi kind show screw american justic system the poor boy found guilti evid even consid logic would dictat guilti proven innoc appar one brain manag take detail account made scenario bit inconceiv to object possibl angri men one film age well overal good movi like vintag trend slowpac closeddoor film you also go see like film denounc timeless issu still occur today also like henri fonda want watch still play greatli it great old school classic definit wast time peopl like u gener z if dynam courtroom movi would advic watch recent one just merci trial chicago releas last year,Positive
"12 Angry Men is the tailor-made type of movie that was common in the 1950s but has become non-existent today. It is all dialog, relies heavily on acting, and is short but sweet in its running time. All this adds up to one of the most satisfying watching experiences available in the movies. Henry Fonda plays a juror who has a ""reasonable doubt"" that the boy they are trying might not be guilty. From beginning to end, no matter who is standing against him, he continues to vote not guilty.

Slowly, but surely, Juror #8 begins to raise questions and doubts about the validity of the witnesses boy being and the evidence against the boy being accused of his father. Soon, more than just one juror thinks he may not be guilty, and this leads to some fantastic drama.

For this type of movie, the two most important issues were handled very well. The acting is top-notch all around, especially Fonda as the quiet, gentle man who sees something wrong with how most of the jury takes the evidence blindly. Lee J. Cobb also sticks out as Juror #3, a man with severe personal problems that tend to influence his decision. The script is tight but very good at exploring all areas of the judicial system and the stereotypes many of us have about it. All in all, this movie very openly discusses the importance of life and how when it hangs in the balance of a group of men's hands, it should not be rushed into but rather thought out and analyzed.

Sidney Lumet does an excellent job of pacing the movie and keeping the suspense all throughout right to the final shot. It isn't a movie everyone will enjoy, but for those who want something more out of their movies, 12 Angry Men says something and then some. One of the best court-room dramas ever made.",angri men tailormad type movi common becom nonexist today it dialog reli heavili act short sweet run time all add one satisfi watch experi avail movi henri fonda play juror reason doubt boy tri might guilti from begin end matter stand continu vote guilti slowli sure juror begin rais question doubt valid wit boy evid boy accus father soon one juror think may guilti lead fantast drama for type movi two import issu handl well the act topnotch around especi fonda quiet gentl man see someth wrong juri take evid blindli lee j cobb also stick juror man sever person problem tend influenc decis the script tight good explor area judici system stereotyp mani u all movi openli discus import life hang balanc group men hand rush rather thought analyz sidney lumet excel job pace movi keep suspens throughout right final shot it isnt movi everyon enjoy want someth movi angri men say someth one best courtroom drama ever made,Positive
"The human mind is trained to identify good or bad storytelling as one's been told stories one's whole life. 12 Angry Men tells you a story and hits it out of the ball park.

If you ever feel that a 1950s movie will be boring and cannot be compared to the present ones, let me tell you something. I was of the same notion while people urged me to watch this movie and boy was I glad I finally listened to them.

12 Angry Men is a storytelling masterpiece with a fantastic script. It does have great acting but the dialogue and the narrative convinced me that this was the greatest story that was ever told via motion pictures.

"There are, that I know of, two legal systems, the Anglo-Saxon adversarial system and the French system. The French system has judge and jury as paid legal officials. The idea behind that is that trained and experienced legal officials at all stages of the process can deliver a better verdict. But the weakness is that such a system is more open to political corruption. In the English system there is judge, jury - made up of ordinary people who are drafted - and barristers. With some tweaks, the American system follows the British system.

Which is the better? An un-answerable question but a fascinating one.

I have always thought there is a moral ambiguity at the heart of this film. The number of genuinely decent, intelligent, educated and well-meaning jurors seems to be outweighed by the number of bigoted, prejudiced, mentally lazy and ill-educated ones. In the latter category, what psychologists today call those affected by 'motivated reasoning', made founding US father Alexander Hamilton distrustful of pure democracy and hence his electoral college to elect the President. So this film is a powerful disquisition on both the Anglo-Saxon jury system and democracy. Actually, any legal system is intimately a reflection of the political system.

The moral core of the film is Henry Fonda, of course, whom Republicans today would call a 'bleeding-heart liberal'; certainly some of the characters in the film called him that more or less literally so that conservative pejorative labelling is not new. His willingness to give the young defendant, accused of killing his father, in what some of the jurors lazily called an 'open and shut' case, what you Americans call a 'fair shake' is what drives the plot. Then other jurors, better intentioned, rally to his standard and others less enlightened subsequently rally to his standard, as most people do to a true leader, one of his persuasive qualities and of his quality of character, if only to follow the tide of loyalty.

One of the jurors calls Henry Fonda's character an exponent of the soft-sell. But that plain-Joe juror doesn't understand the difference between selling marmalade, which is the latter's job, and intelligence allied to a genuine conscience, which are the hall-mark qualities of Henry Fonda's 'architect' persona.

Solon, the ancient Greek lawgiver, was once asked what would it take for justice to come into this world. He replied that justice would only come into this world if enough people who did not suffer injustice would feel for those who did. We are not there yet.

In any film, play or novel a successful one is one in which all the leading characters are well-rounded and you feel that if you met them on the street you would recognise them immediately. This the film amply fulfills. Apart from anything else, the film is a master-class in top American actors of the late fifties.

I would certainly like a Henry Fonda character on my jury if I ever faced murder in the first degree.

But the curious thing is, the curious thing is, that on reviewing the evidence as it is presented in the film and despite the attempt at rebuttal which is the agenda of this film, I think the evidence stacked more against the defendant than for him! But I repeat, I would surely pray for a Henry Fonda character on my jury.

One of the characters in the Sidney Lumet's excellent 'The Verdict', (1982) a wise old black doctor, (I likee how it was so aptly described as a 'legal Rocky') consoles Paul Newman's lawyer with the sentence that juries can sometimes surprise one in the rightness of their verdict.

"12 angry men. I've always thought the jury system was imperfect - 12 people from the general population - none of them lawyers, and most if not all, by the laws of probability,,not versed in legal idiosyncrasies. It only takes one very strong, articulate and confident juror to be able to convince the other 11. None of them are trained. It's all pretty much based on gut feeling. And most of us are sheep. Even though I've always thought - via my untrained instinct - that the jury system was fundamentally flawed, I've never really seen it challenged in film or conveyed in such a powerful way as 12 angry men did. Not only was the film entertaining on a theatrical level, it also rings true today. Is there a better system to judge guilt or innocence? I don't know. But this film demonstrates that the current system (bear in mind this was released in 1957) is anything but foolproof.

"This movie came out of an era that I really loved, when ensemble acting was so strong. We had a whole group of character actors who really took seriously the smaller roles that they had. The direction by Sidney Lumet on this film is outstanding. To take the Henry Fonda character from the meek, inconsequential juror, simply putting forth a theory, to watching the other men slowly see his way of thinking, is subtlety at its best. Lee J. Cobb does his burn, done in by impatience and inconvenience. Pusing an agenda that fits only him. Underlying the entire plot is the defendant whom we never see but get to know through a slow, methodical, yet fascinating series of revelations. It's quiet, suspenseful, and human. It's the true whodunnit without Hercule Poirot. This is the element that is most obvious; that 12 men can sit in a single room for the entire movie and interact and still keep us totally occupied. Enough has been said about this. I just wish that contemporary film making could take a bit more from these masterpieces; let the fine actors that we have do their individual things.",thi movi came era i realli love ensembl act strong we whole group charact actor realli took serious smaller role the direct sidney lumet film outstand to take henri fonda charact meek inconsequenti juror simpli put forth theori watch men slowli see way think subtleti best lee j cobb burn done impati inconveni puse agenda fit underli entir plot defend never see get know slow method yet fascin seri revel it quiet suspens human it true whodunnit without hercul poirot thi element obviou men sit singl room entir movi interact still keep u total occupi enough said i wish contemporari film make could take bit masterpiec let fine actor individu thing,Positive

"There's some interesting alchemy going on in this film. While it's extremely realistic in it's look and attention to detail, it's a highly stylized and somewhat mechanical film. All the characters are clearly defined by the single aspect they bring to the scenario and they interact more like types than real people. The story doesn't show you what's on it's mind, it flat out tells you by putting the parts of it's thesis into the mouths of the characters. None of this really matters though because between it's exceptional cast and Lumet's masterful direction. what you get is a finely tuned machine of a film that's the best film ever made of it's kind.

"The film Twelve Angry Men did not interest me as much as I thought it would. I cannot get myself to pay attention to old-fashioned movies, mostly because the older films are in black and white.

I'm so used to listening and watching new movies with such amazing quality, that when I have to watch an old film, I lose interest very quickly. The actors in this film were not good in my opinion. They did not show different emotions to make the acting seem more realistic. Lastly, it was difficult to follow along during the film because the characters had no names. Even though I disliked a lot about the film; there are still a few things I enjoyed about it. One of them being the main idea of the film, I enjoyed the main idea because it was about a crime. Crime stories are one of my favorite genres. An interesting point that I noticed was that the movie and the written play reminded me of philosophy because the jurors would never know the exact answer or what actually happened. It was also brought to my attention of how often the votes changed throughout the film. This showing that there were good points and examples to cause the jurors to change their votes. Lastly, it's interesting that the only action that was given throughout the movie was Juror No. 10's yelling.

"Wow. Many movies don't hold up very well. This isn't one of the movies. 12 Angry Men is about 12 angry men that sit in a court room discussing whether or not a boy should be considered guilty or not guilty. Simple right? Well, this boy is being accused of murdering his own father and is also going to be given the death sentence. Seriously, what's not to love about this film? I really loved how it doesn't show you the court case which saves time and most importantly, gives you a neutral view of the case. This also makes what the dialogue a lot more interesting. The more they discuss the case, the more you learn about it. This is even more genius because you don't even know if the evidence they are discussing is factual. I also loved how distinct all the men were. Especially for a black and white film, it could've been very difficult to tell who's who but by not giving them names and instead giving them each their own personality. The guy with the high pitched voice, the guy who gets mad all the time, it's easy to know who's talking and what their stance is on this case. Honestly the only thing that bugged me about the film was the unoriginal soundtrack/score. It didn't fit very well and sounded cliché.

Set exclusively in a jury room, the film exceeds the four corners of its setting presenting themes with great depth and handle about politics, interpersonal relationship, prejudice, bias and hope. In the age of social media and instant news, the film asks us to question our personal thoughts and belief. The film is a cinematic triumph of logic over emotion.

A story about 12 men sitting as jurors faced with a decision to deliver a verdict on an accused teenager, the jurors are locked as a single hold out, Juror 8, played by Henry Fonda votes not guilty. Against overwhelming odds, Juror 8 manages to convince another juror who proclaims it is not easy to stand alone from the ridicule of others. The film gradually reveals more questions as a guilty verdict beyond reasonable doubt is slowly eroded and each character's motivations is gradually revealed. Every juror presents his arguments but these all fall when reasonable doubt exists attacking the testimony as more and more jurors vote not guilty. Despite being confined to a single room, the film is nonetheless a thriller. The film slowly reveals that men are often dictated by emotion and not reason. Juror 3, played by Lee J. Cobb, is the main antagonist but is also at heart and the opposite end of the film's struggle between guilty and not guilty. The subplot of his relationship with his estranged son finds resolution when he becomes the final juror to vote not guilty from guilty. With a cast to envy portraying every imaginable human emotion, 12 Angry Men flawlessly treads its themes with character growth in a cathartic ending. Even its black and white color is a representation of the gray area people live in a prejudiced world.

Ultimately, the film speaks about our everyday politics but also as a redemption and heroic tale against odds. 12 Angry Men will continue to be appreciated for generations to come and deserves its place among cinema's masterpiece.

"No funny characters. No complex story. No huge cast. Just about average acting. Keep the story tight, not too complex. And stick to it and don't deviate. End result? Grand Success. Thats what this movie tells us. The story could be about anything. It doesn't have to based on a real-life or an inspiring story.

12 Men talk about a same thing which will decide a young man's fate. How simpler could you put a story in a single line? Whats so breathtaking or even attention-drawing about this storyline? Really nothing.

But as they talk, we are amazed to see how people could take different views over a same thing. Its also amazing to see, as a movie, the strength relies on the story and how it is told and not on characters,photography etc! The acting is just so cool and everybody gets a good share.

Almost ninety percent of the movie happens inside a room where these dozen men do nothing but talk.

"12 Angry Men is a film which should be taken for what it is. A brilliant and engaging script draws in the viewer and as the events unfold, we are left truly captivated.

The film shows how perceptions in human nature can be clouded by bias, prejudices, or indeed ones' desire to see a baseball game. The subject is even perhaps less about the actual guilt or innocence of the chosen party, than the turmoil the jurors have in deciding so.

Although this movie may be a tad plot-driven and lacking a bit of creativity in directing, taking the film for what it is, it is a great success.",angri men film taken a brilliant engag script draw viewer event unfold left truli captiv the film show percept human natur cloud bia prejudic inde one desir see basebal game the subject even perhap less actual guilt innoc chosen parti turmoil juror decid although movi may tad plotdriven lack bit creativ direct take film great success,Positive
"""Life Is In Their Hands -- Dealth Is On Their Minds!"" A tag-line of 12 Angry Men.

12 Angry Men had 3 nominations for Oscars and won 13 other awards, but it does not mean that every one will like this movie. While the movie started with the dark and white atmosphere it gave me a tiresome impression. 12 men were just sitting in a room quarreling and sometimes murmuring and muttering. Are movies only providing human acting and talking?

Teenagers like me like to have something much exciting, but not sitting dully in a room. Secondly, I wasn't engrossed in the Juror quarreling during the film. I don't think most of you are interested in others' affairs, especially others' conflicts. Also, as the tag-line shows, the life and death of the boy is in their hands, but how about the audience? It seemed that we have already been left out. In addition, Henry Fonda is a good actor, however, when the movie ends, I think everybody would have asked ""Is that all?"" I still had a hope to see anything unexpectedly broken out before the ending, but what a pity that it did not happen.

It may be a great masterpiece to most of people but I hardly have a slight interest on it. My comments might have changed if the 'debate' had an unpredictable result.",life is in their hand dealth is on their mind a taglin angri men angri men nomin oscar award mean everi one like movi while movi start dark white atmospher gave tiresom impress men sit room quarrel sometim murmur mutter are movi provid human act talk teenag like like someth much excit sit dulli room secondli i wasnt engross juror quarrel film i dont think interest other affair especi other conflict also taglin show life death boy hand audienc it seem alreadi left in addit henri fonda good actor howev movi end i think everybodi would ask is i still hope see anyth unexpectedli broken end piti happen it may great masterpiec peopl i hardli slight interest my comment might chang debat unpredict result,Positive
"This is a movie that has no gunfights, explosions, car chases, or epic set pieces, but it still remains one of the tensest, most exhilarating films in cinematic history. This is a movie that works based solely on the performances of the actors, the dialogue scribed by the writers, and the direction of Sidney Lumet. Almost the entirety of the film is set in one room, but Lumet uses a variety of techniques to create different feelings of claustrophobia and isolation all within the confines of that room.

"12 Angry Men is the film that changed my opinion about all black-and- white films. Before this film, I think this type of old films is boring, so I don't ""waste"" my time with these ones. But when I watched this film, I changed all my mind about it.

The film is literally masterpiece. There is no action or mind-blowing parts. All story goes on in one room and the thing is almost everything seems as mystery, but real. The case which our jury have to decide about, jurors, their actions and judgement is so well considered. One of the most interesting parts of the film is that no name mentioned until the very end.

Also it is very hard to shot the whole film only in one place, one room. So crew had done great work. A piece of art. So I think it is the best film to start old and gold films.",angri men film chang opinion blackand white film befor film i think type old film bore i dont wast time one but i watch film i chang mind the film liter masterpiec there action mindblow part all stori goe one room thing almost everyth seem mysteri real the case juri decid juror action judgement well consid one interest part film name mention end also hard shot whole film one place one room so crew done great work a piec art so i think best film start old gold film,Positive
"This is one of the best films that I have ever seen. I saw it for the first time in a business class and that day I made my a trip that I have never forgotten. It is the type of films that you begin thinking that you are going to be bored, and after some minutes, your curiosity begins to grow until the moment when you fall in love with it. It is a trip of understanding, of doubting about everything and a lesson about the truth that usually is not something that can be seen at a first look. A wonderful script, perfect performances and a great direction. The unique thing that somebody that likes cinema can say about this film is that it is a masterpiece that need to be seen more than one time to really see all the nuances and to really appreciate it as it deserves. It is in the Top 10, but maybe it should have a better position.

"A black and white film consisting entirely of a jury arguing a case within the confines of the jury room, sounds like watching paint dry, right? Well that's what my perception was for years and was determined not to bother regardless of the strength of the reviews both from critics and fans.

But films that are mad as among the best have good reason for their reputations (usually). Like Citizen Kane I had to eat humble pie after watching this one. Even though I had already read how the film ended the journey was never less than fascinating and intense with some interesting points raised about class privileges and prejudices against people one might look down on based on their type. All the characters were fully fleshed and there were a lot of shades of grey to work through.

I love modern action extravaganzas such as The Avengers as much as the next guy but the beauty of film means that there is a full spectrum of diverse stories to be appreciated. I think if I had a bet with anyone who said this film ""sounds boring"" I'd make a profit if people gave the honest truth after watching it.",a black white film consist entir juri argu case within confin juri room sound like watch paint dri right well that percept year determin bother regardless strength review critic fan but film mad among best good reason reput usual like citizen kane i eat humbl pie watch one even though i alreadi read film end journey never less fascin intens interest point rais class privileg prejudic peopl one might look base type all charact fulli flesh lot shade grey work i love modern action extravaganza the aveng much next guy beauti film mean full spectrum diver stori appreci i think i bet anyon said film sound bore id make profit peopl gave honest truth watch,Positive

The tension from all the characters arguing made for a great film. They didn't rely on any special effects which is a nice change. I hope more people get a change to enjoy this film.

"Lee J. Cobb singlehandedly could have ruinsed this film with his yelling and overacting and supremely annoying nature. Ed Begley doesn't help out much either with an equally over the top redundant presence. All the other performances are actually quite good although Jack Warden tends to get on the nerves occasionally as well. The story is original and excellent, and despite some flimsy arguments used to acquit the kid, the movie is compelling in parts. Actually it's pretty obvious they let a guilty go free because they looked through rose colored glasses at the facts but that's not the issue because stuff like that happens every day in our system. The exchanges between the jurors were ridiculous at times and believable at others. Inconsistent yet enjoyable. The 9 rating is absurd, especially since it really doesn't hold up over the years as good as some others of the era. I'd put it at a 7 but am gonna rate a 5 to counterbalance the inflated rating here.",lee j cobb singlehandedli could ruin film yell overact suprem annoy natur ed begley doesnt help much either equal top redund presenc all perform actual quit good although jack warden tend get nerv occasion well the stori origin excel despit flimsi argument use acquit kid movi compel part actual pretti obviou let guilti go free look rose color glass fact that issu stuff like happen everi day system the exchang juror ridicul time believ other inconsist yet enjoy the rate absurd especi sinc realli doesnt hold year good other era id put gonna rate counterbal inflat rate,Positive
"Perfect. That's what 12 Angry Men is. Perfect. There isn't a thing about this movie I didn't love. The tension, the pacing, the room they're in, the acting, the filming, the directing, it's all perfect. Quite frankly, I'm a little mad that I hadn't seen this film sooner.

The thing that stuck out to me perhaps the most was the pace and tension. Often, especially with older films, the pace tends to be relatively slow compared to more recent films. Yet, 12 Angry Men never slows down. There isn't a dull moment to be had. The only break we as the viewer get is when the jurors take their bathroom breaks. And even then, the conversations and debate continue. I personally love films that never ease on the pace and tension, and this one certainly doesn't.

I also loved the pacing in terms of the story. The way information was revealed to the viewer in these deliberate increments made me get on the edge of my seat and stay there until the film ended. I was, of course, on the side of Juror #8 from the get-go, so I was always rooting for him to get his view through. But that doesn't mean that I would deny the fact that the opposing side made great arguments as well. As such, I was constantly waiting for what the counter-arguments from both sides would be.

For a film about 12 men sitting in one room debating about their decision as a jury, 12 Angry Men is incredibly tense. And without that tension, this film wouldn't work. The reason, I believe, this film is so tense, is because the viewer is just as torn about the case as the jurors. The constant barrage of opposing views, both giving strong arguments, make it difficult to make up your mind. Just as much as it is a film about human nature and how opinions and preconceived ideas can affect our thinking, it's a film that forces the viewer to tackle these problems personally.

12 Angry Men blew any expectations that I might have had right out the window. No matter how many great things I had heard, I never expected it to be so fantastic, and quite frankly perfect. I loved that it happened on the hottest day of summer and everyone was sweating. I loved that as soon as it started raining the fan started working. And I loved that it stopped raining as soon as they left the court building.

Others starts to ask questions. In many ways it reminds me of one of my favorite movies, To Kill A Mockingbird, were Gregory Peck does the same thing, only as a defence attorney.

"This film deserves its #5 spot on the top 250 best films of all time (According to IMDb). And there is one thing that I noticed about this film. Everything great is because of the writing. The acting, Emotions, Characters, Plot, personal self-enjoyment, and even the cinematography are all vastly improved by the writing. The acting is excellent but without such a great script all of it would seem unrealistic. For example, see some of the scenes in the star wars prequels. I believe that some of the people who acted in them were good actors but had horrible dialogue written by George Lucas that made their acting look awful. For example, I haven't seen it but Hayden Christensen is known for having a great performance in the film ""Shattered Glass"" Made in 2003 but since his most popular films are badly written, he is known as a bad actor. This films writing however made all of these actors well known for being some of the best of their time.

The emotional core of this film is driven by the writing and although that might seem obvious to you, other people may still think it's driven by the excellent acting, but don't realize that the acting is driven by the writing.

The characters in this film are some of the best I, and most people (who have seen this film) have ever seen. We start the film in a room with 12 strangers and get to know them over time until the point where they feel like real humans and you don't feel like you're watching a film anymore. Once again the writing is the main attribute but this time it's driven by the acting and the writing. I will admit that even with this excellent writing you can still have a bad performance.

I've seen a few people saying this is boring, but I have no idea how you could ever think that. The premise might seem boring, you may ask ""Why one room for 99% of the film?"". But trust me and almost everybody else when I say that this is not boring at all. The writing and the plot make this a very enjoyable drama/mystery film. Whenever you see a film, don't assume that it's boring, read the plot, look at the genre, and decide if it will be your thing.

Lastly, the cinematography in this film. It's very creative and has a lot of hidden things in it. For example, (SPOILERS HERE) When Juror 7 (Henry Fonda) slowly convinces more people, the camera moves down because he is becoming the boss and he is now above everybody else, but at the beginning the camera is above him, showing how everybody else is above him. (END OF SPOILERS) Now that is really cool and the writing helped make that possible.

Overall, as I said at the beginning this is truly one of the best films of all time and it deserves its place on the IMDb top 5. It's a masterpiece and it goes straight into my top 10. This is my longest review yet so I hope you liked it. Goodbye! 9.8/10.

"After ""Pulp Fiction"",this was the movie which I really respect for DIALOGUES.As this is actually a very old movie I only saw it recently--- when my craze for watching old movie started.I had only seen melodramatic old Indian movies and decided to mitigate my broken mind by not watching old movies anymore.But after watching 12 angry men,my excitement for watching old movies bolstered to a great extent! I actually watched it manly for the rave reviews it had received.I realized that this is the movie which inspired,many recent movies based on murder trials.When I started watching the movie,I was actually skeptical about how the movie would proceed,if it were to be confined to a single room!!The development of the first ten min of the movie----- from the 12 jury men sitting in the courtroom hearing the case to how they start the discussion about the case in the jury room----- was actually one of the simplest,but the most realistic sequence I had seen!I mean especially to find it in a old movie was actually surprising.The way the jury members sweating due to the scorching heat,was shown in a very authentic manner.

Based on the teleplay of the same name by Reginald Rose,the story is how one the jury members(Henry Fonda) convinces the rest of the 11 members that the murder trial under the discussion is not as simple as it seems.The movie then develops with conversations about how the case is discussed and sorted out!Frankly my verbiage is not enough to describe the brilliance in development of the plot!!As movie proceeds,the screenplay not just depicts a murder case,but also depicts the beautiful sketching of each of the characters.The way the argument proceeds with the infusion of their mindsets to the case is so realistic that,you at some point might feel that the screenplay was written by the screenplay writer actually sitting in a real jury room!!The camera work is simple,but exclusive especially in depicting various erratic emotions of each person.I personally felt that the performance of Lee J Cobb as the short tempered and intransigent jury member was the best!!His anger depicted was like watching my father shouting at me!!!!!

So finally thanks to Sydny Lumet for his thought provoking direction.It is,according to me, his best movie till date.The true meaning of an HERO is very well defined in this film!Henry Fonda not only should be just appreciated for his acting,but should also be haled as an iconic hero portraying aggressive candor and calmness.So please watch this movie mainly for the simple,but taut screenplay.Lastly I do not mean to offend old Indian movies,its just my opinion.If not for the melodramas of those times,I don't think our culture would have been preserved till now.",after pulp fictionthi movi i realli respect dialoguesa actual old movi i saw recent craze watch old movi startedi seen melodramat old indian movi decid mitig broken mind watch old movi anymorebut watch angri menmi excit watch old movi bolster great extent i actual watch manli rave review receivedi realiz movi inspiredmani recent movi base murder trialswhen i start watch moviei actual skeptic movi would proceedif confin singl roomth develop first ten min movi juri men sit courtroom hear case start discus case juri room actual one simplestbut realist sequenc i seeni mean especi find old movi actual surprisingth way juri member sweat due scorch heatwa shown authent manner base teleplay name reginald roseth stori one juri membershenri fonda convinc rest member murder trial discus simpl seemsth movi develop convers case discus sort outfrankli verbiag enough describ brillianc develop plota movi proceedsth screenplay depict murder casebut also depict beauti sketch charactersth way argument proce infus mindset case realist thatyou point might feel screenplay written screenplay writer actual sit real juri roomth camera work simplebut exclus especi depict variou errat emot personi person felt perform lee j cobb short temper intransig juri member besthi anger depict like watch father shout so final thank sydni lumet thought provok directionit isaccord best movi till dateth true mean hero well defin filmhenri fonda appreci actingbut also hale icon hero portray aggress candor calmnessso plea watch movi mainli simplebut taut screenplaylastli i mean offend old indian moviesit opinionif melodrama timesi dont think cultur would preserv till,Positive
"""12 Angry Men"" (1957) marks the directorial debut of Sidney Lumet, and features a great lead performance by Henry Fonda, and an outstanding supporting cast, including Lee J. Cobb, Ed Begley, and E. G. Marshall, based on an earlier teleplay by Reginald Rose.

The 12 Angry Men referenced in the title are the twelve jurors of a murder trial who are tasked with the civic duty of deciding the guilt or innocence of an 18-year-old young man, accused of murdering his father.

The film takes place almost entirely in the jury deliberation room, and while that may sound as entertaining as watching paint dry, the film has a claustrophobic sense of tension that permeates every single frame, and it is an essential and searing look into the American justice system that is still startlingly relevant over 60 years after it's initial release.

It's quite simply the best legal drama ever made, and an absolute masterpiece of a film, that serves as a masterclass of small-budget filmmaking (it cost only $337,000 to make in 1957) and features one of the most profound and powerful individual scenes ever captured on film!

"It has been described as ""flawless"", ""immaculate"" and ""supreme"" -and for good reason. '12 Angry Men' is an old Swiss golden clock in the age of Japanese digital watches, a Flemish renaissance mahogany armchair in the era of prefabricated furniture, a handcrafted motion picture at a time of processed film-making. Henry Fonda is the sole dissenting juror in a murder case, who utilizes rational methodology to convince the remaining eleven jurors that the accused is not guilty as charged. Filming almost exclusively in a small, nondescript jury deliberation room, director Sidney Lumet produces a masterpiece of American film-making, reaching the limits of structured cinematic delivery. The opening segment, which rolls uncut for over 10 minutes, is unparalleled, as is the dramatic sequence of the murder recreation. Assisted by an outstanding theatrical script, the film's cast members literally forget to act, allowing their roles as jurors to inhabit their conscience as they perform. Notably, E.G. Marshall (juror #4) splendidly captures the essence of his role as a prudent financier, while Lee J. Cobb (juror #3) writes cinematic history with his phenomenal portrayal of Fonda's leading adversary among the jury. Last but not least, the film's didactic quality is multifaceted, on the one hand illustrating how educated citizens can guide, rather than endure, the democratic process, and on the other hand illuminating how moral purpose and artistic dedication can guide a film's production in ways Hollywood creators often choose to neglect. Overall, a solid film that has earned the respect of successive generations of movie audiences.",it describ flawless immacul suprem good reason angri men old swiss golden clock age japanes digit watch flemish renaiss mahogani armchair era prefabr furnitur handcraft motion pictur time process filmmak henri fonda sole dissent juror murder case util ration methodolog convinc remain eleven juror accus guilti charg film almost exclus small nondescript juri deliber room director sidney lumet produc masterpiec american filmmak reach limit structur cinemat deliveri the open segment roll uncut minut unparallel dramat sequenc murder recreat assist outstand theatric script film cast member liter forget act allow role juror inhabit conscienc perform notabl eg marshal juror splendidli captur essenc role prudent financi lee j cobb juror write cinemat histori phenomen portray fonda lead adversari among juri last least film didact qualiti multifacet one hand illustr educ citizen guid rather endur democrat process hand illumin moral purpos artist dedic guid film product way hollywood creator often choos neglect overal solid film earn respect success gener movi audienc,Positive

"12 Angry Men is not an extravagant movie. Most of the film takes place inside a small jury room - no extravagant sets in this movie. This gives us incentive to focus on the three strengths of the film - the acting, the dialogue (written by Reginald Rose) and the direction (by first-time director Sidney Lumet).

The acting is outstanding. There is a long shot that takes place before any talk of the case, and simply based off this shot, we can tell so much about these characters - which way they will vote, whether they can relate to the boy on trial, and which of them will collide in the future. Special mentions of course go to Lee J. Cobb and Henry Fonda, the two opposites whose conversations are some of the most interesting in the whole movie. Lee J, Cobb's revelation scene at the end of the movie alone shows how multilayered he can play his characters.

The dialogue is spectacular, and I am of the opinion it is one of the best scripts ever written for the movie screen - possibly the best. Every character speaks based on their motivations: Juror 5 speaks based on his experience as a kid from the poorer areas, Juror 3 speaks based on his own son, and Juror 7 speaks based on his desire to get to a baseball game. These motivations color their arguments and distinguish each of them from their peers, and ths is exemplified in the script. This film also contains the single greatest line in film history, delivered by Juror No. 8 to Juror No. 3 after No. 3 threatens his life. When you watch the scene, you'll know the line.

And finally, the directing is masterful. The film's limited set means that the director, Sidney Lumet, had to come up with creative ways to frame shots to aid the film's storytelling. He does this by shooting in wide shots at the start of the movie, and slowly bringing the camera closer to the actor's faces, putting more emphasis on their reactions and reinforcing the claustrophobic size of the room. The scene where the men walk into the outside at the end is basically catharsis.

12 Angry Men is a smart and engaging movie, and feels like it was made with every element completely fine-tuned to make one of the greatest movies of all time. I think this movie needs to be seen by everyone, not just to enjoy it, but to see how dialogue can be used masterfully to enhance a story.",angri men extravag movi most film take place insid small juri room extravag set movi thi give u incent focu three strength film act dialogu written reginald rose direct firsttim director sidney lumet the act outstand there long shot take place talk case simpli base shot tell much charact way vote whether relat boy trial collid futur special mention cours go lee j cobb henri fonda two opposit whose convers interest whole movi lee j cobb revel scene end movi alon show multilay play charact the dialogu spectacular i opinion one best script ever written movi screen possibl best everi charact speak base motiv juror speak base experi kid poorer area juror speak base son juror speak base desir get basebal game these motiv color argument distinguish peer th exemplifi script thi film also contain singl greatest line film histori deliv juror no juror no no threaten life when watch scene youll know line and final direct master the film limit set mean director sidney lumet come creativ way frame shot aid film storytel he shoot wide shot start movi slowli bring camera closer actor face put emphasi reaction reinforc claustrophob size room the scene men walk outsid end basic catharsi angri men smart engag movi feel like made everi element complet finetun make one greatest movi time i think movi need seen everyon enjoy see dialogu use master enhanc stori,Positive
"This is a movie I could watch every day without growing tired of it. Every word spoken holds your attention. No franchise film, or action flick, or war movie, or romance, or drama, or ANYTHING ELSE captivates the way that small-scale, single-set, script-focused films do oh-so-naturally. And the benchmark for such films is 12 Angry Men, a timeless classic about one man standing alone to prevent a grave injustice. A boy is accused of murdering his father. The defense attorney was utterly disinterested, so the prosecutor's case appeared clean-cut. When 11 jurors quickly move to convict without a second thought, one juror (Henry Fonda) decides to vote for acquittal just to ensure the accused got a fair shot.

This is an eloquent, cerebral film that stands peerless in its field.",thi movi i could watch everi day without grow tire everi word spoken hold attent no franchis film action flick war movi romanc drama anyth el captiv way smallscal singleset scriptfocus film ohsonatur and benchmark film angri men timeless classic one man stand alon prevent grave injustic a boy accus murder father the defens attorney utterli disinterest prosecutor case appear cleancut when juror quickli move convict without second thought one juror henri fonda decid vote acquitt ensur accus got fair shot thi eloqu cerebr film stand peerless field,Neutral

"As for the previous man's post regarding the lack of cinematic pyrotechnics in this films, I'd like to mention that I thought the means with which this story was told was actually quite brilliant. Sure, there are dated elements to the dialogue and we've come quite a long way technologically with which to please the visual sense. Further it seems that our ""eyes"" have grown accustomed to jump cuts and when they are lacking, well, it's sort of like the analogy of a fast food meal versus a sit down dinner. While a burger and fries are fine, even fantastic at times, it sure ain't a meal you'll never forget. With films like this you have to slow yourself down and appreciate the manner with which it is told. Thoughtful framing and movement of camera subconsciously underscore the message.

"I have watched this movie many times. I finally bought the DVD the other day and watched it again! The level of acting and the intensity of all the performances have, without exception, always taken my breath away. It is a movie that I love and never tire of watching.

You forget, as you watch the movie, that pretty much the entire movie takes place in one room. Movies today, actors today, would not be able to maintain the level of suspense that this movie created and hold your attention for the entire hour and 36 minutes. It starts off slowly, and you become part of the jury stuck in that ""jury room"", frustrated as one man holds out because ""he is not sure"".

Henry Fonda gives an amazing performance as the one-man holdout but all the actors give tour de force performances, and you sit mesmerized as one by one they are all converted. But it is Fonda and Lee J Cobbs, as they fight for the hearts and minds of the other jurors that keeps the tension going. The movie was a good social commentary of the times, regarding the racial intolerance, prejudices and biases that governed people in that era.

"The other reviews pretty much sums it up. It's a great movie, that really proves that 12 good actors is all you need to make a top notch movie. It might be old, slow and sometimes really predictable; but for a movie from 1957 it might be the first movie to ever do anything like this. If not the first; it's the first one to nail it.

If you are going to sit down and watch this movie, do not expect a movie with a lot of cool movie effects, because it doesn't have any. People nowadays seem to think that a movie is slow and not good if it goes more than 2 minutes without any action. In this movie they, as mentioned earlier, proves that if the movie has a good lineup of actors, and a good manuscript/director; and set your mind to it, you start putting yourself into the mind of the actors as real people and not actors.

That alone makes this better than most movies I've ever watched.

"""12 Angry Men"" (1957), I have heard people go nuts over this ""film"", time and time again. The hype was insane between everyone I've heard who mentioned anything about it or anything related to it. So, I finally gave in and put it on. What a major disappointment! It is, without a shadow of a doubt, one of the top 10 most boring films I've ever seen in my life. I've seen a lot of dull and boring movies, but this ""film"" excels at both of those aspects. This ""movie"" has a boring story, standard to horrible acting and a generic dull soundtrack. As far as the story goes, it's one of the most uninteresting, boring, unnecessary and unbearable I've ever seen. It's only 96 minutes, but it felt like I was watching it for days! The storyline is, 12 jurors argue on whether a person is guilty or not guilty. Seriously, that's the whole movie, just 12 boring characters sitting in a boring room talking. How riveting! Right? You might as well hide a couple of video cameras in a jury room and press record, same thing! Now, I have seen movies before that take place in a single setting from beginning to end. Some were good, some were bad. ""12 Angry Men"" is probably one of the worst examples of how not to make a film taking place in the same location. It was so dull, that I could barely fight to keep my eyes open! Another big issue is lack of character development. The main characters are cast as: Juror 1, Juror 2, etc. Yes, we do find out their names at the end when they introduce themselves. That's one of the biggest cardinal rules when making a movie or TV show, character development. This ""movie"" has virtually none of that. The only positive about this ""film"" is that it somehow inspired a lot of tributes and parodies on TV shows. Those were so much more entertaining than this pile of filth! Before you guys tell me, ""it's realistic, this movie is supposed to be as close to a real-life scenario as possible."" I'm all for movies with realism. When done right, it can be very effective! ""12 Angry Men"" is a little bit too real. Wow, I never thought I'd hear myself say that! Overall, the plot of this ""movie"" is so bad, that describing my feelings toward it as angry is an understatement. That's one of the two worst things a film can do; anger me, or bore me. ""12 Angry Men"" does both! As far as the acting goes, it's just as bad, unfortunately. From the whole entire cast! The only ones who actually seem to be trying are Henry Fonda, E.G. Marshall, Martin Balsam and Jack Warden. All of the rest of the performances were either bad or just plain boring. It's a real pity, because all of these actors are great in other movies and TV shows. What happened here? Finally, the soundtrack in this ""movie"" is overall very generic and not memorable in the least. There are a couple of parts of the film score that aren't too bad. The opening theme during the opening credits and the ending theme. As for the rest of the soundtrack, it's just a failing pile of trash. Now, let's get to the positive elements in this ""film"". Yes, surprisingly, this ""movie"" has some good things in it. All of the sets/locations and the special effects are good. The only thing that almost cost the sets/locations star is that it is in black and white. That just accentuates the boredom of the environment. But, it suits the story, or lack thereof, in this ""movie"". So, I still give it a pass at the end of the day. Finally, the special effects are good and still hold up to this day. My only nitpick is that all of the words in the opening and closing credits are all lower case. Did a kid write the titles and credits? Or, did someone forget to capitalize? ""12 Angry Men"" has found a place on my most disappointing films list and most boring films list. It's a real shame, because I really tried so hard to like it. But, it did next to nothing for me. I'm struggling to rate this ""film"" 2 out of 5 stars on my scale, which equates to 4 out of 10 IMDB stars. Just stay away from ""12 Angry Men"", it sucks, plain and simple. The sad thing is, that there are schmucks out there who like it, and some even consider it to be their favorite movie! Why? What are you all drinking? God forbid any of you watch an exciting movie, you may have a heart attack! ""12 Angry Men"" in my verdict is guilty of all charges.

"Nowadays, it's hard to find a screenplay that's based solely on dialogue. The mere suggestion of locking 12 men in a room, having them debate with each other and making a movie out of it in the 21st century would be unheard of - God forbid people might actually like it!

I'll be honest, that was my initial reaction upon reading a brief summary of this movie. But being a fan of classics, I knew that somehow this would work. There is no need for a visualization of the crime; there is no need for fancy props (save for a knife and a diagram), there is no need for special effects. The powerful acting and emotional dialogue in this film are enough to sell its message, and it is a meaningful message at that.

"I love this film, and watch it whenever it's on. It was adapted from a television play by Reginald Rose, and directed by Sidney Lumet. A deceptively simple story of twelve jurors who must decide the fate of a very young man who may or may not have killed his father. These men are a cross-section of American and in particular New York society, circa 1957, and range from the working to the upper middle classes; from the highly sensitive to the appallingly crude; and from those who think they're smart and perceptive and often are not, to those who think little of themselves and who really ought to rate themselves more highly. The play is so intensely written, and Rose had such an excellent ear for dialogue, that one often finds oneself caring more for the jurors than for the outcome of the case they're deliberating.

At the start of the film, there is one holdout for not guilty against the eleven who believe, with varying degrees of sincerity and seriousness, in the guilt of defendant. It's the job of the lone juror to convince the rest of the logic of his position, which is one of reasonable doubt. It's here that Mr. Rose, or rather his lead character, plays fast and loose with the rules of evidence, as has been pointed out over the years; and while I'm generally a stickler for rules when it comes to matters that plays and movies are often reckless with, especially where medicine and science are concerned, I make an exception in this case due to the excellence of the writing, and of the movie as a whole.

If ever there was an actor's film, it's this one. Every actor gives a superb performance. Some characters are better conceived than others, and thus John Fiedler, as the milquetoast of the bunch, and Ed Binns as the working man, are at somewhat of a disadvantage, no fault of the actor. Ed Begley's character, a bigot, starts out interestingly, then descends into somewhat of a cliche, which is too bad in way, since Begley was at the top of his game at this stage of his career. Martin Balsam's sighing self-pity is put to excellent use in his performance of a man who likes to coach football. George Voskovec is magnificent as a foreign-born watchmaker who challenges Jack Warden's loudmouth salesman. I've never seen Warden better than he is here. His character is a jerk and a joker, borderline Runyon, or rather the way Runyon types often are in real life: insufferable. Warden plays for effect rather than charm, and has a way of making other performers look good in their reactions to him, which tend to be unfavorable. E.G. Marshall is imposing as the icily superior stockbroker, oozing contempt for others while maintaining a facade of fairness. Not a bad man, just a snob, of the sort one encounters often in the real world, seldom in the movies. Lee J. Cobb is the juror with a deep personal involvement in the case, and becomes in time the nearest to a true villain (albeit a pathetic one) of the piece; while Henry Fonda's dissenter more or less wears the white hat. Cobb gives the sort of highly charged, emotional performance he gave in On the Waterfront, a bit quieter here, and not so malevolent. He was brilliant at conveying the demons of men who don't know they have demons. Fonda manages to be saintly with becoming sanctimonious. His character has the thankless job that liberals often take on, which is that of defender of the damned. One senses at times that the man would rather be elsewhere, that he's a tad too retiring for the this sort of thing.

What I remember most fondly about the movie is its exploration of the architecture of the human face, often in close-up or medium shot. We see old faces and youngish ones, the craggy and the smooth, the granite-jawed and the slack-jawed. There are anxious faces with eagle eyes and lazy ones with drowsy eyes.

"12 Angry Men (1957)

What makes a movie shot almost entirely in a single room so compelling? It isn't the built-in civics lesson, even though it does make you glad for the jury system. Even more than the apparent plot about twelve men and their deliberations about a crime, there is a plot about human nature. The men are all etched just enough to become types--not stereotypes in a bad sense, miraculously, but kinds of people we recognize. And with amazing economy, the strengths and flaws of those kinds of people, simplified too much for reality but compressed just perfectly for the movies, become the guts of this play of passion.

It doesn't hurt that the editing is supremely crisp, the continuity is spot-on, and the casting is brilliant, if color-blind (see below). It also doesn't hurt one bit that the cinematography by Boris Kaufman (see On the Waterfront), is that really clear, dramatic black and white photography of post-noir 1950s. It's beautiful and startling, showing at times the interactions of the group in the room as a whole in a kind of walking ballet, and at other times close-ups of hot faces straining to come to terms with the other eleven people in the room. In other words, this is a technically virtuosic ensemble piece, cast and crew, top to bottom.

As viewers, it is this coming to understand people that makes us part of the scenario. We might see ourselves or our friends in these people, but even if they are strangers, if they seem a full half-century away from our own types, they are still people we are curious about. Sitting on a jury, being locked together in a room, and having to decide about the execution of the accused, all of this makes you grapple with personalities and motives quickly. There is not getting around deciding--both on the verdict, of course, but also on what kind of men are in the room. Why are they voting one way or the other? What makes them stubborn, or wise, or clever? Or funny, annoying, selfish?

The all white male jury is potentially a problem. It should have been a problem back then, when planning the movie, and it becomes one now because the movie represents history, whether or not it likes it. After the Civil War (by amending the Constitution, and with a Civil Rights Act in 1875) it was illegal to exclude blacks from juries, and this was tested in court many times (often in the South). New York City could easily end up with an all white jury (and downtown Manhattan it isn't unlikely) but it is surely conspicuous for a movie trying to represent the sweep of humanity in a single room. Likewise with women, who by the 1930s were regularly part of New York City juries. In the 1950s, white men might have been more clearly enrolled on the lists used to select jurors (such as voting lists), so again, an all-male white jury isn't so unlikely, just conspicuous.

Having said all that, I think the movie works partly because on some simple level, the jurors are all the same! To have made them more clearly diverse would have changed the way we saw them get to know each other. Having one guy be from a ""slum"" and know about knives is revealed slowly, and we can't really outwardly distinguish that man from any other. Even the one clear immigrant has assimilated. So 12 Angry Men isn't an accurate capsule or a documentary exercise, but a study in types and countertypes, reactions and resistance to action.

Director Sidney Lumet cut his teeth for a decade with early t.v. and when he ventured into movies (this was his first success) he did so with a visual reaction against the flatness and static cameras of much of that medium, back then especially. He and Fonda worked together notably in Fail-Safe, another politically charged drama in black and white (and one where Fonda is again trapped in a small room). And later, in Dog Day Afternoon and Serpico (both starring a young and amazing Al Pacino) he again uses a highly charged external problem to deal with psychological responses that are even more intense.

I want to live long enough to see this movie in 2057, just to see if it holds water once that period is looking quaint and distant (the way 1909 does to us from here). Already, as much as this is a fabulous, inspiring, vivid movie, it is also showing its seams, its contrivance, and its agenda too clearly. For now it's a concise dramatic masterpiece.",angri men what make movi shot almost entir singl room compel it isnt builtin civic lesson even though make glad juri system even appar plot twelv men deliber crime plot human natur the men etch enough becom typesnot stereotyp bad sen miracul kind peopl recogn and amaz economi strength flaw kind peopl simplifi much realiti compress perfectli movi becom gut play passion it doesnt hurt edit suprem crisp continu spoton cast brilliant colorblind see it also doesnt hurt one bit cinematographi bori kaufman see on waterfront realli clear dramat black white photographi postnoir it beauti startl show time interact group room whole kind walk ballet time closeup hot face strain come term eleven peopl room in word technic virtuos ensembl piec cast crew top bottom a viewer come understand peopl make u part scenario we might see friend peopl even stranger seem full halfcenturi away type still peopl curiou sit juri lock togeth room decid execut accus make grappl person motiv quickli there get around decidingboth verdict cours also kind men room whi vote one way what make stubborn wise clever or funni annoy selfish the white male juri potenti problem it problem back plan movi becom one movi repres histori whether like after civil war amend constitut civil right act illeg exclud black juri test court mani time often south new york citi could easili end white juri downtown manhattan isnt unlik sure conspicu movi tri repres sweep human singl room likewis woman regularli part new york citi juri in white men might clearli enrol list use select juror vote list allmal white juri isnt unlik conspicu have said i think movi work partli simpl level juror to made clearli diver would chang way saw get know have one guy slum know knive reveal slowli cant realli outwardli distinguish man even one clear immigr assimil so angri men isnt accur capsul documentari exercis studi type countertyp reaction resist action director sidney lumet cut teeth decad earli tv ventur movi first success visual reaction flat static camera much medium back especi he fonda work togeth notabl failsaf anoth polit charg drama black white one fonda trap small room and later dog day afternoon serpico star young amaz al pacino use highli charg extern problem deal psycholog respons even intens i want live long enough see movi see hold water period look quaint distant way u alreadi much fabul inspir vivid movi also show seam contriv agenda clearli for concis dramat masterpiec,Negative
"I remember seeing 12 Angry Men about 10 years ago and really enjoyed it, but I watched it a bit closer last week, and realize what a great movie it really is. I love the movies of the 40's and 50's and I would have to say that 12 Angry Men is up there as one of the best 5 movies of that era for me. There are some many things happening in this movie, that it takes more than one viewing to pick it all up. The camera work is first class, starting off with full view of all 12 jurors, and as the movie progresses and the jurors re-asses their decisions, the camera show the jurors looking straight down the lens, giving the impression they are talking straight to the audience. No names are given till the very end of the movie and then it is only 2 jurors, apart from a quick scene in the courtroom and outside at the end, the rest of the movie is filmed in the jurors room on a hot stinky summers days.

Although not a long movie, the emotional turmoil felt by the jurors is explosive and the audience are drawn into the same gut wrenching feel. I highly recommend this movie.",i rememb see angri men year ago realli enjoy i watch bit closer last week realiz great movi realli i love movi i would say angri men one best movi era there mani thing happen movi take one view pick the camera work first class start full view juror movi progress juror reass decis camera show juror look straight len give impress talk straight audienc no name given till end movi juror apart quick scene courtroom outsid end rest movi film juror room hot stinki summer day although long movi emot turmoil felt juror explos audienc drawn gut wrench feel i highli recommend movi,Positive
"This is another classic film which I am certain nobody realized would be a classic when it was made. I doubt that director Sidney Lumet realized fully what he had in the cast he assembled, for many of the names were not yet household words in 1957, the year 12 Angry Men was produced. The names are impressive: Henry Fonda, Ed Begley, Lee J. Cobb, E.G. Marshall, Robert Webber, Jack Warden, Martin Balsam, Edward Binns, John Fiedler and a very young Jack Klugman are the players we recognize today as belonging in the Who's Who of American character actors of the era. Edward Sweeney and George Voskevec, capable artists in their own right, round out the cast. The story intrigues. Except for short sequences at the beginning and end, the story takes place entirely within a stuffy jury deliberation room. A jury of 12 men is charged with determining the guilt or innocence of a young man accused of murdering his father. In the beginning of deliberations, only Fonda believes the young man innocent. The story's brilliance comes in how it progresses to 11-1 for a guilty verdict to finally a 12-0 vote for acquittal. Along the way, we are introduced to each of the jurors in subtle and not-so-subtle ways. The reasonable juror portrayed by Fonda, the hot-headed ultra conservative played by Cobb, the shallowness of Warden's character, and E.G. Marshall's thoughtful stockbroker are a few examples of character development within the setting of a jury room on a hot night.We learn much about the background and psyche of each juror as we progress along and the talents of each cast member shine brightly within the framework of an interesting story, a story which contains more than a little bit of social commentary on the times in which it was filmed.

12 Angry Men is a must see for anyone interested in the human psyche and social commentary.",thi anoth classic film i certain nobodi realiz would classic made i doubt director sidney lumet realiz fulli cast assembl mani name yet household word year angri men produc the name impress henri fonda ed begley lee j cobb eg marshal robert webber jack warden martin balsam edward binn john fiedler young jack klugman player recogn today belong who who american charact actor era edward sweeney georg voskevec capabl artist right round cast the stori intrigu except short sequenc begin end stori take place entir within stuffi juri deliber room a juri men charg determin guilt innoc young man accus murder father in begin deliber fonda believ young man innoc the stori brillianc come progress guilti verdict final vote acquitt along way introduc juror subtl notsosubtl way the reason juror portray fonda hothead ultra conserv play cobb shallow warden charact eg marshal thought stockbrok exampl charact develop within set juri room hot nightw learn much background psych juror progress along talent cast member shine brightli within framework interest stori stori contain littl bit social commentari time film angri men must see anyon interest human psych social commentari,Neutral

"One word should sum up this movie: BORING

This movie is just NOT for everyone. Unless everyone now means everyone who does not mind to to watch a couple hours of a small group of man arguing in a closed room in black and white.

Compare a movie like this to something which is enjoyable on every level, has as a great story, possibly a great adventure, that might have a couple laughs in it, maybe visuals, maybe some other pleasant moments, that can move your heart, and make you feel moved after you've watched it.

So the next time someone tells you go watch the angry man it's for EVERYONE, maybe you can learn something from it.

just tell them: it's definitely not for EVERYONE. As great as it might be at what it's trying to do, it's still BORING to me.

"12 Angry Men is a film that deals with a number of issues including racism, justice, and standing up for what we believe is right. The acting is amazing and the story is even a better.

The main conflict is the decision 12 men must make about the fate of a young African American man who has been accused of murdering his father in cold blood with a knife. It seems to be quite obvious to the majority of the jurors that the kid is guilty, except for one man. When the men vote on the guilt of the buy, it is 11 guilty, 1 not guilty.

As the film moves forward, we see the one man (juror #8) fight as hard as he can for what he believes to be right.",angri men film deal number issu includ racism justic stand believ right the act amaz stori even better the main conflict decis men must make fate young african american man accus murder father cold blood knife it seem quit obviou major juror kid guilti except one man when men vote guilt buy guilti guilti a film move forward see one man juror fight hard believ right,Neutral
"It as been a while, that I wanted to see this movie, but I never was brave enough to see it, since it is a 90 minute movie, where the movie it's all concentrated on a 12 men deliberation. Otherwise, this movie actually surprised my ideas, indeed.

This movie is surprisingly brilliant, it is very simple but wonderful at the same time, it just shows how can a simple movie without any special effects can be turn to a real masterpiece. The whole cast is amazing, specially Henry Fonda and Lee J. Cobb which made this film even more incredible, thanks to their powerful performances. The characters are impressive, there is a wonderful job on that department, all jury's are different from each other, in personality and class terms, which in my opinion made a very good character extension. The dialog was genius, very original and creative. Filmography was beautiful, the camera focusing the juror's faces was really impressive with the black and white picture as well. What also impressed me was the impact that this all discussion between the 12 men can make a perfect impression of our society of today, even though this film was made in 1957.

This is really an outstanding classic movie, which is really worth to see, and that I really wasn't expecting for its marvelous success.",it i want see movi i never brave enough see sinc minut movi movi concentr men deliber otherwis movi actual surpris idea inde thi movi surprisingli brilliant simpl wonder time show simpl movi without special effect turn real masterpiec the whole cast amaz special henri fonda lee j cobb made film even incred thank power perform the charact impress wonder job depart juri differ person class term opinion made good charact extens the dialog geniu origin creativ filmographi beauti camera focus juror face realli impress black white pictur well what also impress impact discus men make perfect impress societi today even though film made thi realli outstand classic movi realli worth see i realli wasnt expect marvel success,Positive
"12 Angry Men may just be a perfect movie and if it isn't, then it's pretty damn close. I can't think of another film that was simply people in a room arguing for an hour and a half that captured my attention as much as this one did. If you can write a script that keeps people entertained by simply listening to what you wrote then you deserve limitless praise. Watching these men slowly examine every detail of the case they're given and watching them internally and externally debate whether or not the accused kid is guilty is some of the most riveting pieces of cinema that has ever been filmed. This very well could be in my top 10 favorite movies list and I cannot praise it enough.

"This movie is my favorite classic movie that has great plot that really makes you think. Taking place in a courthouse for the entire movie, 12 jury men discuss whether or not a man is guilty of murder. 11 of the men think he is guilty, mainly because they just want to go home. But one man thinks he may be innocent. They discuss the murder throughout the entirety of the movie. I believe classic movies are generally looked down upon by my generation (teens) just because it is old, this angers me that people are that ignorant, this movie is truly impressive and timeless.

"This timepiece of Americas' societal history, which illustrates the differing opinions of the average citizen, brings to light the influence on a persons' opinion, based on the collective opinion.

"Rose (w) - Lumet's (d) high theater on attitudes that often bedevil jury deliberation: sloth (J7) and prejudice (10) are well known, but also bias, when a juror acts as co-counsel, here, Cobb (3) for the prosecution, Fonda (8) the defense, both pushing the group think to effectively stop further debate, and then the struggle all empanelled should engage by being objective while ultimately forming a conviction. The men first appear, eleven, anyway, too quick to convict, then fall like dominoes, too easy to acquit, running hot or cold, acceding to whichever advocate has his air of authority turned on high. It's a trying watch in grade below Sidney's 1982 masterpiece, The Verdict (Warden Binns) that opens with a mawkish camera pan in beg of sympathy for a defendant of whom we know nothing, and ends by leaving the impartial viewer feeling that maybe justice was not done after all. But there is plenty of passion throughout with the power to make us think and that's always a plus.

And it's worth keeping this in mind when being moved to and fro by the dialogue and dramatics: It's fair to judge the personalities of the 12 jurors, to a point, and workings of their deliberations, but their value as such and any vote they render early or late in the process is completely within their own purview as they in the story sat through the trial and we the viewers did not, excepting the judge's flat closing instruction. It might then be wise to not vest heavily on the guilt question (2/4).",rose w lumet high theater attitud often bedevil juri deliber sloth j prejudic well known also bia juror act cocounsel cobb prosecut fonda defens push group think effect stop debat struggl empanel engag object ultim form convict the men first appear eleven anyway quick convict fall like domino easi acquit run hot cold acced whichev advoc air author turn high it tri watch grade sidney masterpiec the verdict warden binn open mawkish camera pan beg sympathi defend know noth end leav imparti viewer feel mayb justic done but plenti passion throughout power make u think that alway plu and worth keep mind move fro dialogu dramat it fair judg person juror point work deliber valu vote render earli late process complet within purview stori sat trial viewer except judg flat close instruct it might wise vest heavili guilt question,Neutral
"Released in 1957, this is about a group of jurors deciding the fate of a young boy who is accused of murder. One man believes he is not guilty and attempts to convince the rest of the jurors of his innocence. This is, without a doubt, one of the best dramas ever created. Nice short runtime, small cast, all filmed in one room...it's just so tight!! The beauty of it is that just from dialogue alone we are thoroughly entertained and it maintains a sense of tension throughout. The crime is never re-enacted, it's from the descriptive dialogue that we picture it in our heads. Writer Reginald Rose knew that the most powerful tool in film (at that time) was words. The cast was high calibre, Henry Fonda leading the view of not guilty...it's pretty difficult to go against him when he is full of suaveness and so convincing. We get to know each juror as the film goes on and we soon start to explore the possibility that their personal lives are tainting their decision. That, was what made it so palpable. It was clouding their judgement, and their stubborn personalities made it all the more satisfying if they did change their mind. Persuasion is a powerful tool, but add a hint of conviction and you can manipulate anyone's mind. Several nice details were included, I like the fact it was set on the hottest day of the year. The heat evidently getting to the jurors, it made them more irritable and heightened the angry emotions within. Director Sidney Lumet did so much in such a little space, technically. When the jurors enter the room, its a sublime long five minute shot and he manages to share the screen time with each juror equally. He was able to convey their personalities instantaneously just by their attire, then when the discussion commences we start to dig a little deeper. The screenplay really is the winner here, if anything it makes me want to work in law! Dramas do not come better than this, 12 Angry Men easily gets the perfect rating.

"Sidney Lumet's 12 angry men it's a perfect example of how beautiful a movie can be if it focusses on the story, characters and conflict. Released in 1957, this courtroom drama is about the complexity of human behaviour even though at first it seems to be just a boring black and white movie.

The entire film takes place in a room where 12 jurors have to decide the fate of a young man who has been accused of murder. At first it seems obvious that he is guilty but juror # 8, portrayed stunningly by Henry Fonda, forces them to carefully consider the evidence before jumping to a hasty verdict. This is where the film sends the message to stand up for what you believe and not settle just because everybody else is. Being very well scripted and focused on it's conflict, the film manages to make every juror fall into a different archetype.

Moreover, 12 angry men makes a commentary about the judicial system and how it's pretty unfair for someone's faith to be in the hands of people of the same race and gender, their verdict being able to be dictated by prejudice or even racism. I think one of the best scenes in the entire movie is the one where juror #10 tries to justify the guilt of the accused by making a racist comment and everyone else turn their backs on him and start ignoring him. Also, another thing that makes this film so gripping it's the attention to details and the way they come up with new ideas, me being a fan of mystery movies I found it really entertaining.

Despite the lack of actual action, 12 angry men is a very captivating and fascinating film and I can only conclude this review by saying it's a must see for everybody.

"There are very few movies that make you go speechless, remain awestruck due to their sheer concept and execution. This is one such movie.

12 men, each from a different background, different views and opinions, strangers to one another, come together, along with their personal prejudices, to reach a decision acceptable to all. This line itself shows the magnitude of complexity involved, and to make a movie out of it is a work of true genius and a one that leaves you spellbound.

Right from the first shot, till the final one, you are so engrossed that you would even forget to breathe. If the background sound track, screenplay, script, direction are the cake, then the roles enacted by the characters (I say characters here, not the actors, because you believe they are truly the 12 angry men) are the icing on top of the cake.

Surprisingly it was only after the movie, did I realize that it was a black and white movie. The movie shows that to make a good movie, you don't need exotic locations or high drama, or superstars. All you need is a good story and good actors who make you forget they are merely playing their parts in the play.

The movie teaches you how an analytical mind and logical thinking can make a difference of life and death. It teaches you to be the most responsible when you have a person's life at stake. It shows how our personal prejudices and upbringing can affect our reasoning, how our senses play with our sense of judgment, how we let our emotions take over, at a time when it is required to be fair and impartial, how we tend to be a part of the crowd because we scared to be the odd – man-out. How one man, one true, sensible and empathetic man, it takes to make a difference. How important it is to have an objective and open mind, at any point of decision-making - in life/ death matters. How we are so stuck upon the facts and what we see, that we forget to use our mind, the ultimate powerful tool that we have. And that all it takes is sense and reason to convince someone, not decibels.

"This is arguably one of the best movies ever made! no big budget, no explosions, no action of course. and almost full movie takes place in a room only with 12 men.

the plot revolves around 12 jurors deciding a fate of a young boy accused of murder and i don't want to spoil it for u. as the movie paces on in first half, u get to know the different characters of 12 men, the plot is thrilling and makes you at the edge of your seat. all of the 12 actors, their performances are really strong. u will find it hard to root for which one! :)

"wow, this movie really gave me that ""Shawshank Redemption"", intelligent dialogue,and not much physical moment feeling. This movie was great. It didn't need big expensive scenes or computerized takes, it was all in the talent and the moment. I do have to say that with all the high ratings I did kind of expect a surprising, slap in the face ending, but instead this movie came out as a ""Reservior Dogs"" and ""Pulp Fiction"" ending that just sort of hung there, but I suppose that's just one of its many significance that I have not yet realized. This movie contained some of the finest gathering of actings in the history of filmmaking. Even though this movie takes place mostly in one room, but the actors still were able to play the parts as if they lived it.

in summary i give this movie a 8/10.

"There are simply not enough positive words in the English Dictionary to describe how superbly brilliant this film is.

Suffice to say it is my all time number 1 favourite film. It is also in my view, Henry Fonda's best role.

I think what I liked more than anything else in this film, is Henry Fonda sticking his neck out from the crowd, standing for what is right and what is just, against the ridicule of others.

Directed by Sidney Lumet in 1957, and produced by Henry Fonda himself, this is a masterpiece of cinema and acting.

Any half decent bloke watching Fonda play his part, will likely as not relate to Fonda 100 per cent.

If you only ever get the chance to watch one more movie your whole life, watch 12 Angry Men starring Henry Fonda, made in 1957.",there simpli enough posit word english dictionari describ superbl brilliant film suffic say time number favourit film it also view henri fonda best role i think i like anyth el film henri fonda stick neck crowd stand right ridicul other direct sidney lumet produc henri fonda masterpiec cinema act ani half decent bloke watch fonda play part like relat fonda per cent if ever get chanc watch one movi whole life watch angri men star henri fonda made,Positive
"This is the best film I've ever seen. Adding a bit of personal touch, I can say this is the only film I've seen more than 3 times (5 times). I even created this account on IMDb just to review this film.

Being accustomed to color films, initially I thought that this film would be quite dull and boring. But I still decided to give try, considering the high rating given to it in most of the movie rating sites.

Initially, at least for the first 10 minutes, it was boring. The jurors were chatting among themselves, going to washrooms, cursing the heat... But as the actual arguments began, it became interesting; I mean really interesting. Of course, it was obvious what the final verdict would be: the boy was to be acquitted. But the way the arguments were presented was fabulous. It never appeared like a film. Instead, it appeared to be a real debate- with jurors showing emotions, ego and prejudice- just like in real life. The acting was fantastic with almost all actors performing extremely well( 8 of twelve were very good. Rest four were good enough, though slight improvements were possible. I forgot their numbers so I'm cant point 'em out)

There isn't much of a plot to this film. Almost whole of this film is made up of dialogues. In fact the plot is so small that it can be written in less than 50 words( movie is about 100mins long).The entire filming(90%) takes place in just one room (including attached bathroom).

Basically, its the arguments that makes this film an all time masterpiece. Traditions may change, style may change, but logic and rationality doesn't.

In my opinion this movie is a ""must watch"".

P.S.: DON'T WATCH THE REMAKE AT ANY COST. It is terrible. I mean really hopeless. Yes, it is in colour, but the acting is so bad that I couldn't watch it for even 10 minutes. It appears like a sham. The dialogues are almost the same as the original film but lacks the charm. I would prefer watching the old movie again over watching the remake. The jurors appear to be anxiously waiting for their turn to speak out the dialogues they have memorised. The main character appears weak and fragile. The other jurors appear like students acting in school plays: only thinking of when their turn comes, stiff, lacking spontaneity.",thi best film ive ever seen ad bit person touch i say film ive seen time time i even creat account imdb review film be accustom color film initi i thought film would quit dull bore but i still decid give tri consid high rate given movi rate site initi least first minut bore the juror chat among go washroom cur heat but actual argument began becam interest i mean realli interest of cours obviou final verdict would boy acquit but way argument present fabul it never appear like film instead appear real debat juror show emot ego prejudic like real life the act fantast almost actor perform extrem well twelv good rest four good enough though slight improv possibl i forgot number im cant point em there isnt much plot film almost whole film made dialogu in fact plot small written less word movi min longth entir film take place one room includ attach bathroom basic argument make film time masterpiec tradit may chang style may chang logic ration doesnt in opinion movi must watch p dont watch the remak at ani cost it terribl i mean realli hopeless ye colour act bad i couldnt watch even minut it appear like sham the dialogu almost origin film lack charm i would prefer watch old movi watch remak the juror appear anxious wait turn speak dialogu memoris the main charact appear weak fragil the juror appear like student act school play think turn come stiff lack spontan,Positive

"Hitchcock once said you could stage an entire film in a telephone box; and '12 Angry Men' triumphantly demonstrates the excitement that can be generated just by a bunch of guys talking around a table. (The dramatic highlight simply consists of a closeup of Juror 4's face as the penny finally drops.)

When I first saw this film at the age of 13 I knew nothing about it in advance and still vividly recall my mounting excitement when I realised that the action was going to be entirely confined to just the one room.

Although failing to win a single Oscar and dying at the boxoffice '12 Angry Men' created enough to be parodied on 'Hancock' and remained the film in which Henry Fonda took the most pride. (He later said he'd commissioned Sydney Lumet to direct this version of Reginald Rose's television play because he knew that he'd be good with actors but that his skill with the camera came as pure gain.)

Films set in courtrooms are so common it's become a genre in it's own right, but after nearly seventy years '12 Angry Men' continues to stand in magnificent isolation as the sole film confined simply to the jury.

Since I originally saw this film as a teenager I have probably seen it again about half a dozen times and each time I discover something new (it took several viewings, for example, to notice the way the other members of the cast routinely patronise the elderly juror and his often querulous response).

It's easy now to sneer that all twelve are white and male; but the film might be discreetly making the very point that the defendant - briefly seen at the very start - whose life is in their hands is obviously hispanic; one of what Juror 10 dismissively describes as 'them'.",hitchcock said could stage entir film telephon box angri men triumphantli demonstr excit gener bunch guy talk around tabl the dramat highlight simpli consist closeup juror face penni final drop when i first saw film age i knew noth advanc still vividli recal mount excit i realis action go entir confin one room although fail win singl oscar die boxoffic angri men creat enough parodi hancock remain film henri fonda took pride he later said hed commiss sydney lumet direct version reginald rose televis play knew hed good actor skill camera came pure gain film set courtroom common becom genr right nearli seventi year angri men continu stand magnific isol sole film confin simpli juri sinc i origin saw film teenag i probabl seen half dozen time time i discov someth new took sever view exampl notic way member cast routin patronis elderli juror often querul respons it easi sneer twelv white male film might discreetli make point defend briefli seen start whose life hand obvious hispan one juror dismiss describ,Positive
"12 Angry Men"" stands as a testament to the brilliance of cinema. Sidney Lumet's direction and Reginald Rose's screenplay intertwine flawlessly, creating an enthralling narrative that unfolds within the confines of a jury room. The film's brilliance lies not in grandiose settings but in the power of human interaction and the complexities of decision-making. It is a timeless masterpiece that transcends its era, remaining profoundly relevant in its exploration of human nature, bias, and the pursuit of truth. It's not just a film; it's a compelling study of the human psyche, a thought-provoking journey that lingers long after the credits roll.

"This courtroom drama is rated second in AFI's 10 Top 10 Courtroom Drama, behind the classic To Kill A Mockingbird. Although the movie is not as great as To Kill AMockingbird, it does boast of excellent acting skills and a nice view of how the human mind works.

Most of the entire movie took place in the jury room. The total time spent outside of the jury room was three minutes out of the full 96 minutes of the movie and the time in the Jury room exposes you to how judgemental the world is.

This drama film was adapted from a teleplay of the same name by Reginald Rose, whose screenplay for 12 Angry Men was initially produced for the CBS program Studio One in 1954.

The film tells the story of a jury made up of 12 men as they deliberate the guilt or acquittal of a defendant on the basis of reasonable doubt that was brought up by one of the jurors. Juror 8 (Henry Fonda) was the juror that brought up the basis of reasonable doubt. He was the movie's protagonist.

Juror 8 had the herculean task of proving to the others that his reasonable doubt was valid since In the United States (both then and now), a verdict in most criminal trials by jury must be unanimous.

As the movie went on, you will see how some of the jurors were seeing things from the view of juror 8 and how some remained adamant.

The movie's main antagonist was juror 3 a stubborn disrespectful man, who no matter what some of the others were able to prove stood his ground, by doing so he kept some of the jurors at his side of the defendant being guilty.

'12 Angry Men' was remade for television in 1997. Directed by William Friedkin, the remake starred Jack Lemmon as one of the jurors. Most of the action and dialogue of the film are identical to the original. Although there was no smoking in the jury room and concentration shifted to income and pop culture.

12 angry men's teleplay has been adapted to many TV series over the years some of these include Hancock's Half Hour, Picket Fences, Perfect Strangers, Family Matters, The Dead Zone, Early Edition, The Odd Couple, King of the Hill, Matlock, 7th Heaven, Veronica Mars, Monk, Hey Arnold!, Peep Show (TV series), My Wife and Kids, Robot Chicken, and The Simpsons.

The movie is exceptionally captivating and you will not regret the time you spent watching this movie.

"It's a good film to show to kids to teach them the dangers of prejudice and the value of a good devil's advocate.

However, it's terribly outdated. For its time, its supremely progressive, but in our time, a jury of all white men would not even get to trial.

It's also hamstrung by heavy-handed moralizing. Maybe back in the day, this was considered subtle, but today, this kind of writing would be considered terribly moralizing.

Yes, maybe the story and idea was groundbreaking back in its day. I wouldn't know. I watched it today. I didn't have the benefit of being unexposed to films of today (which I'm sure ripped this film off).

Removing this quality, the film is laid bare as nothing but a film full of exposition. It's bad filmmaking to fail to make the most of moving pictures and move the story through dialogue. It defeats the purpose of film. And it doesn't excuse this film especially since this film was made in a time when filmmakers where very adept at showing instead of telling. This was just after the era of silent movies. And there are a lot of contemporary films that doesn't suffer from this kind of writing.",it good film show kid teach danger prejudic valu good devil advoc howev terribl outdat for time suprem progress time juri white men would even get trial it also hamstrung heavyhand moral mayb back day consid subtl today kind write would consid terribl moral ye mayb stori idea groundbreak back day i wouldnt know i watch today i didnt benefit unexpos film today im sure rip film remov qualiti film laid bare noth film full exposit it bad filmmak fail make move pictur move stori dialogu it defeat purpos film and doesnt excus film especi sinc film made time filmmak adept show instead tell thi era silent movi and lot contemporari film doesnt suffer kind write,Positive

"I must say that this movie is really well written, directed and performed.

The movie starts with evidence that looks like a clear case, but one juror is not sure. It would be wrong, if I said more about the story, but it develops in a very interesting way.

Each of the jurors have their reasons for finding the accused guilty or not guilty. You see the jurors small talking with each other, and each little story reveals something about the persons. This is perfect character building, it was really made in an impressive way.

The concept is very simple, 12 men discussing a case in a room. It does not sound interesting, but it for sure is. The actors perform excellently, each actor creates an unique character, it is simply just amazing to watch their discussions. I think it would be unfair to mention one actor, because all of them do a fantastic performance.

You could say that it does not require a good director to create such a simple movie, but that is very wrong. Director Sidney Lumet really understood how to focus on the right discussions at the right time, he builds the characters with the camera, he did an excellent job.

""12 Angry Men"" is an impressive movie. I have rated 454 movies, and only 11 movies have been rated 9/10 or above, and this is one of them.

Of course, our judicial system is different from the United States and we do not have a jury.

The beginning and end of the movie was great.

Even though the events of the movie took place only in one room, but the wonderful script of the movie was so good that other things did not matter.

"12 Angry Men could serve as a textbook for how films can be brilliant without any special effects or action sequences. All you need is a good idea, and 12 Angry Men certainly has that.

The film's premise could not be simpler; 12 jurors discuss a case and attempt to determine a verdict. It's as simple as that. In the wrong hands this idea could be a disaster, or at least deathly dull. However, Sidney Lumet has created a riveting character study investigating motivation and prejudices in ordinary men.

The twelve are all from a great variety of backgrounds with widely differing attitudes. However, the case seems clear cut and they are all convinced the defendant is guilty. Except one. As the facts of the case are bandied back and forth, Henry Fonda, as the sole juror returning a not guilty verdict, must convince his eleven fellow jurors to think about the case more.

It is hard to lavish enough praise on 12 Angry Men. It is also the first film I have reviewed where I simply cannot think of any criticisms whatsoever. The film is enthralling and extremely clever; it is impossible not to get caught up in the back and forth as the sole juror attempts to sway the opinions of the other eleven, gradually calling into question what seemed like a clear verdict. It is a fascinating insight into the unseen workings of the legal system, and how ordinary men really play a role in the system. Further, the characters are never given names, there are virtually no supporting actors for the twelve, and the entire film takes place within one room, enabling all attention to be focused on the details of the case rather than identifying with the characters. It is this that makes the film so simple yet unbelievably effective.

Henry Fonda is one of the finest actors of his generation, but no one is overshadowed or shamed by his terrific performance, and everyone holds their own. All twelve actors give outstanding performances.

12 Angry Men is a masterful film that should be compulsory viewing for any filmmaker. There was never a clearer display of what can be done without complicated plot lines, special effects, overblown action sequences or overbearing music. A great idea with a tight script and sound acting performances are all you need to make a timeless classic.

"From a distance, 12 Angry Men might look like your customary courtroom drama that Hollywood churns out every couple of years. Look closer and you will find that Sidney Lumet's debut turn as a director is an exemplary study in characterization and a crash course in pure filmmaking.

Most of the action takes place within the confines of a single room on what is supposedly ""the hottest day of the year"". A jury made up of 12 men has to decide the fate of a teenage boy who is accused of a gruesome murder. The defendant has everything going against him - a couple of witnesses, a murder weapon, a sloppy public attorney and the fact that he is from a less privileged class of the society. Over the next 95 minutes, 12 Angry Man watches as 11 jurors, first convinced of the suspect's guilt overcome their less than democratic prejudices and are slowly won over to the side of reasonable doubt by one man's doubts about the accused's guilt.

Sidney Lumet creates energy and movement through quick editing and varying camera angles, which makes the film pulse with power and emotion despite its one set location. Operating within the constrictions of a limited budget, Lumet tightens the noose by accentuating the excruciating pulse of the ceiling fan and slowly narrowing his shots on his characters as the film approaches its climax. A special mention should be made here of ace cameraman Boris Kaufman, who ratchets up the claustrophobia with every close-up and ably heightens the drama, despite the confining setting. The actors – all 12 of them – are top notch as the '12 Angry Men' in what is to date one of the best ensemble casts to have graced the silver screen.

The drama plays out at an engaging pace making this brilliant war of words an entrancing cinematic experience. Lumet gives us an incisive and gripping film that is as relevant today as it was almost 60 years back.

"I decided to give it a few days after watching this film before writing my review, including enough time to watch several other top-rated films from this time period just to get some further perspective.

The film was simply fantastic, an absolute intellectual orgasm. Never did I dream it possible that a film over 50 years old could make me physically jump out of my chair, leaping and punching the air with glee, after the end credits rolled. I felt an enormous sense of justification in taking the time to watch this very old film.

At the beginning of the film we're presented with 12 indistinct men of no-particular defining characteristics, but by the end of the film we can clearly recall the decisions and personalities of each individual and how they arrived at their conclusions.

Except for very brief opening and ending scenes, the entire film takes place in a single room with nothing else going for it other than the script, acting and camera work. It made me refocus on what film really is; a visual story presented to us by a film-making crew and various actors, but in modern times, sometimes consisting of a much weaker script clouded by heaps of visual effects and the use of technology.

You've really got to see this film to understand why it's so good, currently rated no.6 of all-time on IMDb for a very good reason.

"For a film that takes place almost entirely in one room and is mostly made up of dialogues, I must say it was a blast. Although the premise may sound completely boring for most people, the context in it surpasses most of everything out there. In a way it is a detective story that takes place in a confined room and where all evidence are based solely on speculations and thin reasoning. Through means of possibilities, deduction, and doubt, 12 men are supposed to decide the fate of a young man accused of killing his own father. Although the case seems crystal clear at first, as all the evidence prove his guilt, a single shred of doubt is more than enough to begin a long line of second thoughts and complicating debates. Anyone who loves intelligent disputes and exposed lines of thought behind anything will definitely be mesmerized by its attention to detail.

What makes the movie even more enjoyable is how its characters are not emotionless orthologists or cynical businessmen. Each one of them has a very distinctive personality and his judgment is usually affected by his life experiences and personal bias towards certain social issues. You will see hints of racism, hatred for youngsters, snobing of the poor, even some who don't care and just want to get over with it soon so they can go watch a baseball match.

An extra element that adds to its magnificence is how it is using its laws of that time as well as various details of the society it takes place in. You are constantly given various information regarding law specifics, and cultural events, so you are really made to believe the story takes place in an American state of the 50's. Something which is very important when it comes to any story regarding trials or detective work, since without them one would wonder why wouldn't they just use some fancy CSI method to determine if he really did it (which was impossible at that time) or why are thy even using common people to determine if a man is guilty or not (which happens in very few parts in the world).

The interesting thing is that we are never actually told if the accused man really did the crime or not; that is not the objective of the movie. It is more about following the logic behind the use of a jury to determine the lives of others, as well as how reasonable doubt is more than enough to let someone go free if you are not certain he did it. This would of course mean that lots of people are found not-guilty even when they really did it, but that is not what the movie is all about. It has more to do with upholding the laws of a state in their fullest and in this case they really were.

There are still a few things that annoyed me in the movie, even if they are completely excused for their time and era. The whole film is made up of only white males. Not a single woman or member of a different race. Although the 60's were indeed like that, in a sense it feels kinda racist. That is why I like the 90's remake even more in overall. Although it does not have superstars protagonist in it, it is with color, the characters are behaving in a more natural way (not that wooden feeling of the old movies), there are black members in the jury, the accused is a latino, and the judge is a woman. And despite the 30 year gap, the laws are still used in almost the same way (with only a few minor details presented differently just to adjust to the era) and thus the plot is presented in exactly the same way.

Not that it's feels like much of a problem; it s still an amazing piece of cinema and worthy to be part of most top 10 movie lists with similar categories.",for film take place almost entir one room mostli made dialogu i must say blast although premis may sound complet bore peopl context surpass everyth in way detect stori take place confin room evid base sole specul thin reason through mean possibl deduct doubt men suppos decid fate young man accus kill father although case seem crystal clear first evid prove guilt singl shred doubt enough begin long line second thought complic debat anyon love intellig disput expo line thought behind anyth definit mesmer attent detail what make movi even enjoy charact emotionless orthologist cynic businessmen each one distinct person judgment usual affect life experi person bia toward certain social issu you see hint racism hatr youngster snobe poor even dont care want get soon go watch basebal match an extra element add magnific use law time well variou detail societi take place you constantli given variou inform regard law specif cultur event realli made believ stori take place american state someth import come stori regard trial detect work sinc without one would wonder wouldnt use fanci csi method determin realli imposs time thi even use common peopl determin man guilti happen part world the interest thing never actual told accus man realli crime object movi it follow logic behind use juri determin live other well reason doubt enough let someon go free certain thi would cours mean lot peopl found notguilti even realli movi it uphold law state fullest case realli there still thing annoy movi even complet excus time era the whole film made white male not singl woman member differ race although inde like sen feel kinda racist that i like remak even overal although superstar protagonist color charact behav natur way wooden feel old movi black member juri accus latino judg woman and despit year gap law still use almost way minor detail present differ adjust era thu plot present exactli way not feel like much problem still amaz piec cinema worthi part top movi list similar categori,Positive
"I know what you're thinking: how in the heck did you just now get around to seeing 12 Angry Men? To be honest, I don't really have a good excuse. Maybe I just got too caught up with another film with ""12″ (Monkeys) in the title.

Regardless, I feel ashamed for having waited so long to take this one in. In short, this movie is absolutely brilliant. This isn't a revelation not already proclaimed by a thousand other critics, but I think it's worth noting for the simple fact that contemporary viewers (who might find themselves in my situation and realize they've postponed this for far too long) really owe it to themselves to embrace this multi-layered masterpiece that's just as relevant today as it was 54 years ago.

The plot is deceptively simple: twelve jurors must decide the fate of an eighteen year-old on trial for the supposed murder of his father. Everyone on the jury is a male, and they're all fleshed out with nuanced detail. In fact, considering the entire thing takes place in a sweltering deliberation room, it's absolutely astonishing that director Sidney Lumet is able to concoct such a striking character piece that has a lot to say about the presumptions of society (again, both then and now). This, of course, it what makes 12 Angry Men the timeless piece of art that it is.

But let's not ignore the flawless acting on display by everyone involved. Whether it's Henry Fonda trying to prove that nothing is ever certain or Lee Cobb bringing a father riddled with guilt to a violent and emotionally draining climax, it's all superb. The directing is clean and efficient, too—this, among other things, gives said actors a chance to fully embody their personalities and draw the audience into a drama that's anything but black and white.

It's clear that screenwriter Reginald Rose has a firm grasp on how to effectively use setting, too. As the mood and opinion shifts in the cramped room, so does the bipolar weather just outside the stubborn windows.

I don't know what else to say. If you're like me and have a list of certified ""classics"" that you're just now getting around to, trust me when I say that this one should be vaulted straight to the top. Give it a minute or so to get going, and you'll find yourself glued to one of the most engrossing dramas I've ever seen.",i know your think heck get around see angri men to honest i dont realli good excus mayb i got caught anoth film monkey titl regardless i feel asham wait long take one in short movi absolut brilliant thi isnt revel alreadi proclaim thousand critic i think worth note simpl fact contemporari viewer might find situat realiz theyv postpon far long realli owe embrac multilay masterpiec that relev today year ago the plot decept simpl twelv juror must decid fate eighteen yearold trial suppos murder father everyon juri male theyr flesh nuanc detail in fact consid entir thing take place swelter deliber room absolut astonish director sidney lumet abl concoct strike charact piec lot say presumpt societi thi cours make angri men timeless piec art but let ignor flawless act display everyon involv whether henri fonda tri prove noth ever certain lee cobb bring father riddl guilt violent emot drain climax superb the direct clean effici toothi among thing give said actor chanc fulli embodi person draw audienc drama that anyth black white it clear screenwrit reginald rose firm grasp effect use set a mood opinion shift cramp room bipolar weather outsid stubborn window i dont know el say if your like list certifi classic your get around trust i say one vault straight top give minut get go youll find glu one engross drama ive ever seen,Positive
"'12 Angry men' is not the movie if u have prejudice against black n white cinema, its not the movie if u want Tyre-scorching action.....it is only for those movie goers with subtle touch of patience and want can over look obvious looking simplicity......Story is pretty straight forward of jury deciding the fate of a person who looks to be given a swift verdict.......yet a man comes forward and gives a different viewpoint n challenges every juror in a very subtle way to just 'think again'. This is start of movie which really captivated my attention from start to end, it never required beautiful movie set or location.....the unfolding of story was so good that i was glued to the screen and yet at the end i realized the whole film was shot in a single room, no guns or girls, yet i loved the ending and tell you what at the end you only get to know the name of main 'protagonist' of change of opinion........u just don't need such formalities !

Simply put '12 Angry men' showcases 12 'angry' jurors just looking to seal the fate of a person yet 1 person is managed to change perception of all by power of reasoning and convincing all of them one by one to change, what was pretty much done n dusted verdict.....

You will love the movie if u really have in you the patience to sit in front without expecting any melodrama and yet in the end you will feel really satisfied as if u have seen a action pack thriller !. There are very few movies in Hollywood who can match the level of '12 Angry men', 'Sleuth (1972)' comes close to it in a way but i won't tell how.........

A movie for person who can enjoy cinematic brilliance in a very fine,simple and subtle way and not a movie for ludicrous action-pack stuffed movie goers !",angri men movi u prejudic black n white cinema movi u want tyrescorch actionit movi goer subtl touch patienc want look obviou look simplicitystori pretti straight forward juri decid fate person look given swift verdictyet man come forward give differ viewpoint n challeng everi juror subtl way think thi start movi realli captiv attent start end never requir beauti movi set locationth unfold stori good glu screen yet end realiz whole film shot singl room gun girl yet love end tell end get know name main protagonist chang opinionu dont need formal simpli put angri men showcas angri juror look seal fate person yet person manag chang percept power reason convinc one one chang pretti much done n dust verdict you love movi u realli patienc sit front without expect melodrama yet end feel realli satisfi u seen action pack thriller there movi hollywood match level angri men sleuth come close way wont tell a movi person enjoy cinemat brillianc finesimpl subtl way movi ludicr actionpack stuf movi goer,Positive
"This film is superb, in fact as Shakespeare once said ""Its the bees' knees"". The film captivates the audience from the beginning. Each of the twelve jurors are introduced to us as they are introduced to themselves. The characters are well draw out and individual, each with his own personality.

The tension of the characters draws the audience in from the start. We imagine that the case is open and shut, 11 me saying guilty and 1 not. We feel the discomfort of Henry Fonda as the other characters belittle and mock how he can see any reasonable doubt in the case. But we also share his victories and the enthusiasm as he proceeds to refute or add doubt to the arguments for guilty and are captivated and draw in as other jurors begin to see doubt in the proceedings.

The audience can also see the arguments for guilty and wonder if Fonda's character is correct in saying that he doubts. Yet they also feel the shame of the characters as he disproves that a previously sound theory is iron tight, joining his side as members of the jury do.

On top of this they are wonderfully woven in human elements such as the misconceptions that influence people and the growing tension between different characters. This is brought to life even more by the amazing performances, Fonda, Lee J Cobb and Joseph Sweeney are of particular note.

I started watching this film on a bored relaxed laying about day but by the end i was on the edge of the seat with my hands on my knees feeling more tense than a politician on results day.

"12 Angry Men is a terrific film that reflects a lot of the past problems and the proposed solutions of immigration, youth violence, and of course, overcoming one's own background and discrimination. The film surprised me in how progressive it was, and the ending social conclusions that it reached.

In the film you can see clearly form a rift between the upper class, conservatives who are unwilling to change and the progressives who are proposing change for the better of all of us; this film, deep down, is a very class conscious and socially conscious film about discrimination and the deep lines it had in American society in 1957.

Although the film's portrayal is sometimes overly simplistic, drawing a ""stubborn, pig-headed"" conservative versus ""righteous, just"" progressive, one can find that this was very much so a necessary film for its' time. In many ways, it is a work that was socially far advanced.

Also what is interesting is the fact that it is a film that is done with great simplicity; some actors, and a room... It relies greatly upon the pure talent of the actors, and the great direction of Sidney Lumet -- this film is truly unique due to the true minimalism it embraces in its' production tactics, yet this is something that could easily go unnoticed due to the incredible quality of the film.",angri men terrif film reflect lot past problem propos solut immigr youth violenc cours overcom one background discrimin the film surpris progress end social conclus reach in film see clearli form rift upper class conserv unwil chang progress propos chang better u film deep class consciou social consciou film discrimin deep line american societi although film portray sometim overli simplist draw stubborn pighead conserv versu righteou progress one find much necessari film time in mani way work social far advanc also interest fact film done great simplic actor room it reli greatli upon pure talent actor great direct sidney lumet film truli uniqu due true minim embrac product tactic yet someth could easili go unnot due incred qualiti film,Positive
"Intense courtroom drama which has 12 very different people, all males, struggling with a murder case involving a young Puerto Rican boy that seems cut-and-dried. However, juror Henry Fonda does not believe it to be as sure-fire as it appears. He votes not guilty and what follows is a chain of events that will test the views, beliefs and thoughts of the other 11 members. Fonda is great, but Lee J. Cobb steals every scene (and that is not easy to do in a film like this). Ed Begley, Martin Balsam, Jack Warden, Jack Klugman, Joseph Sweeney, E.G. Marshall and John Fiedler are among the other individuals caught in a situation that is much more difficult than it appears on the surface.

The screenplay is sophisticated and smart, and the story is compelling and intelligent. The film is also brilliantly made, and the acting is superb. Henry Fonda especially dominates the film, with an integrity that makes his character so wonderful, but the other actors are wonderful as well, Ed Begley, Jack Warden, John Fiedler, Lee J Cobb, Rudy Bond et al. are all impeccable support to Fonda.

"Gosh, I don't know how many times I studied this play and performed it in high school, not to mention how many television shows had an episode that was inspired by 12 Angry Men. It was always a great drama because of the raw human emotions that were so true and remain timeless, this play will never be dated. I couldn't wait to see this movie when I saw it at the video store and it was the first movie I slipped into the DVD player. First off, I was incredibly impressed with the credits, we not only had Henry Fonda, we had Lee J. Cobb in the cast! This movie was so well performed and such a treasure, god, I couldn't ever say any words to justify it. I've done this a million times, but here is another summary of what 12 Angry Men is all about.

12 jurors are about to make a decision about a murder case, over all it seems like an open and shut case with tons of evidence that would make any good man look guilty, an 18 year old boy is about to be put to death if convicted. 11 of the men vote guilty, only one vote holds them back and they have to discuss the trial once again due to one vote being not guilty. Jurour #8 refuses to just jump to conclusions and brings up incredible possibilities that can always make a man think of ""reasonable doubts"", one by one the jurors begin to see the points he is making, except for one stubborn #3 who would rather just pull the switch to the chair himself.

12 Angry Men is a timeless tale that could either be told very badly, i.e. 7th Heaven, or incredibly well and bring out terrific performances like Henry and Lee did. Actually, the whole cast was terrific, there wasn't a performance that was off key, movies like this are so needed in Hollywood today, it was so simple, but added so much for a 30 minute play. Please, if you have any taste, you will truly enjoy 12 Angry Men and have a great appreciation for it!

"This is one of those movies where everything could go wrong. The story is as simple as it can be: 12 men are jurors on a open and shut murder trial, but one man thinks that another persons life deserves at least some thought on the matter and votes not guilty. From this point on we have 12 actors and a closed room. This could be the most boring film ever made. Lumet however is a master of mise-en-scene and provides a tense movie that keeps you locked on from the word ""go"". The dialogs are great and supported by incredibly talented actors.

"I could go on, but I thought I'd stop there before my summary line gets too big. Now just because this is a classic movie (and we really should try to use that term lightly, but this movie really deserves it and I'll elaborate on that), does not mean everybody will love it. And if one does not like it, it does not mean they have no taste. They just have different tastes, which is a good thing, because if every human on earth would have the same taste, life would be very boring now wouldn't it? The asnwer is yes, in case you were wondering.

But back to this, which begins outside and takes us inside. And it is important that we were outside because we will live inside a building (a room to be more specific) for the most time. There is also a brief shot of the alleged culprit/criminal. After that we get in a room with 12 men, who are quite different from each other. And while it wasn't yet time to give African American a chance in a movie like that (or Asian American for that matter), there is a critical racial line that is drawn. If you follow what is happening and who says what or argues in certain ways, you will see that this movie has quite the social commentary in it.

Now that is one part of this being genius, because it never rubs your nose in it. It never says, this guy who is i.e. from Italian descent has a reasonable thing/argument to say. No you just hear the things and see the people interact. And I have not even mentioned the way the movie is shot. And I'm not talking about the black and white cinematography (which is beautifully lit), no. I mean the framing and the set-ups. the editing and how everything flows. You feel like you're inside the room. You feel like this really happens or happened. Even the things that seem not staged (someone blocking another person, a shadow, peoples back and more) are in fact staged and masterfully done so.

There are way smarter people than me, that can list you many things this movie has done right and I'm sure there quite a few sources online to look for. Just listening to the audio commentary can give a small glimpse into certain things too. But again, since this is not something that one might call light entertaining, if it does not appeal to you, then it is so.

"This film deserves to be on anyone's list of top films. My problem is that it is so perfect, so seamlessly polished, it is hard to appreciate the individual excellences.

The acting is top notch. I believe that monologue acting is quite a bit simpler than real reactive ensemble acting. Most of what we see today is monologues pretending to be conversations. But in this film, we have utter mastery of throwing emotions. Once the air becomes filled with human essence, it is hard to not get soaked ourselves as the camera moves through the thick atmosphere. Yes, there are slight differences in how each actor projects (Fonda internally, Balsam completely on his skin...) but the ensemble presents one vision to the audience.

The writing is snappy too. You can tell it was worked and worked and worried, going through several generations. It is easy to be mesmerized by this writing and acting, and miss the rare accomplishment of the camera-work. This camera is so fluid, you forget you are in one room. It moves from being a human observer, to being omniscient, to being a target. It is smart enough to seldom center on the element of most importance, so expands the field to all men.

This is very hard. Very hard, to make the camera human. So much easier to do what we see today -- acknowledge the machinery and jigger with it. Do we have a filmmaker today who could do this?

"The plot of12 Angry Men revolves around the murder trail of a Latino boy who is accused of killing his father. The conviction of the boy would mean a death sentence and the destiny of the boy's life is in the hands of twelve male jurors of ranging personalities. The case seems open and shut with a murder weapon and several witnesses to place the boy at the scene of the crime. For eleven of the jurors the decision is apparent that the boy is guilty but for one juror, Mr. Davis (Henry Fonda), the boy's life should entail some discussion to eliminate any reasonable doubt the jurors may have. As the film progresses the personalities of the jurors become apparent and many underlying issues influence the guilty decision chosen by the majority of the jurors.

The underlying issues are the complexity of the personalities of the jurors and the reasons why they have the motivation to feel and act the way they do. As the case unfolds further, more is learned about each juror individually. The personalities range from being a short-tempered loud mouth to a straight- laced accountant who never breaks a sweat. As the movie progresses much more is learned of the characters that exposes the intricacy of human nature and people's different personality traits.

This film is an excellent example of movie making that does not require elaborate sets to entertain the viewer. The majority of the film takes place in a jury room with the men never leaving the room from their deliberation responsibilities. The cast and dialogue make this film memorable and the film has some clear moral issues that are addressed. The main issue is that not everything is as it seems. With further analysis the understanding of a situation becomes more concrete enabling the men to make a solid decision that affects a young man's life. 12 Angry Men is a classic film that should not be missed.",the plot angri men revolv around murder trail latino boy accus kill father the convict boy would mean death sentenc destini boy life hand twelv male juror rang person the case seem open shut murder weapon sever wit place boy scene crime for eleven juror decis appar boy guilti one juror mr davi henri fonda boy life entail discus elimin reason doubt juror may a film progress person juror becom appar mani underli issu influenc guilti decis chosen major juror the underli issu complex person juror reason motiv feel act way a case unfold learn juror individu the person rang shorttemp loud mouth straight lace account never break sweat a movi progress much learn charact expo intricaci human natur peopl differ person trait thi film excel exampl movi make requir elabor set entertain viewer the major film take place juri room men never leav room deliber respons the cast dialogu make film memor film clear moral issu address the main issu everyth seem with analysi understand situat becom concret enabl men make solid decis affect young man life angri men classic film miss,Neutral

I must admit that the intricacies of jury duty selection in the New York area in the 1950's is something of which I know absolutely nothing about.... But I have often wondered if women, for some reason, were exempt from jury duty in New York 65 years ago!?!?!?

Leaving that issue aside, let's focus on the film itself. Some of the actors in the cast, like Henry Fonda, Lee J. Cobb and Ed Begley, were already well known when it was released in 1957. For Most of the others, their participation in this Classic certainly augmented their stature greatly! Although 12 ANGRY MEN was Nominated for Best Picture, Best Director and Best Adapted Screenplay, This Number 6 Highest Rated Movie of ALL-TIME, sadly, struck out at the Oscars... Winning nary a single Golden Statuette! I invite any and all of You reading my Review to focus on each and every astounding characterization rendered in this movie. With each viewing, I have come to appreciate and savor every detail, of every performance, all the more!

As someone who has seen thousands of movies, 12 ANGRY MEN lets You totally get into the head of each and every character... As almost no other film, before or since! 12, layer by layer, methodically peels away the facade that is part and parcel of our subconcious self-protection and insulation from letting ourselves become too vulnerable and over-exposed to scrutiny by others!

If You have never seen 12 ANGRY MEN... for whatever reason... or reasonS... You must place it at the very TOP of Your WATCH LIST! If perhaps, You saw it once, twice...or even three time, many years ago... I beseech You to revisit it! I am absolutely certain that You will thank yourself handsomely for doing so!",thi film submiss greatest ensembl cast perform histori cinema a releas i year old i view multipl occas but honest i cannot rememb exactli i saw first time i must admit intricaci juri duti select new york area someth i know absolut noth but i often wonder woman reason exempt juri duti new york year ago leav issu asid let focu film some actor cast like henri fonda lee j cobb ed begley alreadi well known releas for most other particip classic certainli augment statur greatli although angri men nomin best pictur best director best adapt screenplay thi number highest rate movi alltim sadli struck oscar win nari singl golden statuett i invit you read review focu everi astound character render movi with view i come appreci savor everi detail everi perform a someon seen thousand movi angri men let you total get head everi charact a almost film sinc layer layer method peel away facad part parcel subconci selfprotect insul let becom vulner overexpos scrutini other if you never seen angri men whatev reason reason you must place top your watch list if perhap you saw twiceor even three time mani year ago i beseech you revisit i absolut certain you thank handsom,Positive
"Shot in real time, this story of a jury trying to decide whether a young man is innocent or guilty never lets the viewer's attention go. Henry Fonda plays Juror #8, who is convinced the entire time that the defendant is innocent, while everyone else has already called him guilty. Throughout the movie, we not only get to hear everyone's opinions on the matter, but also every possibility of the verdict. With ""12 Angry Men"", Sidney Lumet brought to the screen the same kind of ""closing in"" feeling that he brought to movies like ""Network"". In the end, the issue is not whether the defendant is innocent or guilty; the important point is the process by which the jurors reached their decision. This may be THE perfect movie.",shot real time stori juri tri decid whether young man innoc guilti never let viewer attent go henri fonda play juror convinc entir time defend innoc everyon el alreadi call guilti throughout movi get hear everyon opinion matter also everi possibl verdict with angri men sidney lumet brought screen kind close feel brought movi like network in end issu whether defend innoc guilti import point process juror reach decis thi may the perfect movi,Positive

"12 Angry Men may be the greatest film of the 1950's. It really is unlike other films, as it's takes place in mostly 1 location, over an hour and a half, and there's no actions - just a conversation. The acting just feels so natural, almost like they improvised the entire film. All the characters are distinct, and very memorable, especially juror 8.

Ultimately, the film is all about influencing a group, and how everything at face value shouldn't be taken for fact. Juror number 8, despite talking the least, has the most influence over the group. Everything that seems a fact, the eyewitness seeing the kid through the passing El train, can be rexamined, and twisted. The film shows the jurors to be tribalistic, and how some of the jurors' mostly strongly held beliefs are also their least challenged. A fascinating film.",angri men may greatest film it realli unlik film take place mostli locat hour half there action convers the act feel natur almost like improvis entir film all charact distinct memor especi juror ultim film influenc group everyth face valu shouldnt taken fact juror number despit talk least influenc group everyth seem fact eyewit see kid pas el train rexamin twist the film show juror tribalist juror mostli strongli held belief also least challeng a fascin film,Neutral
"An excellent 10-star well-acted and well-written movie.

12 Angry Men began with the court, judge, jury and defendant awaiting deliberation.

The movie should have ended with the court, judge, jury and defendant hearing the final verdict. This would have made the movie perfect. It is the responses from all involved in the court room that complete a movie. Sudden quick endings leave a feeling of incompleteness.

"Eleven to one, there is one enter dissenter among the Jury in the trial of a young man who's accused of murdering his father.

This for me is one of the greatest films of all time, it somehow never suffers as the years go past. Twelve men from different backgrounds, with different view points come together, their mission, to determine the guilt of one young man, it's an amiable start, but soon tempers begin to fly as the status quo is questioned.

I love that we're in for the kill as it were, we see no crime, or anything associated, everything we get is given to us by The Jurors, it is an incredible way of telling the story, I can't think of any other film that took this unique approach,

It scrutinises the many weaknesses people have, prejudices, preconceived ideas, anger and personal grievance, but it's balanced out by showing the exact opposite, bravery, faith, intelligence, the ability to listen and question. This film ranks as one of the best studies of human nature in existence.

If you've done jury service you'll relate to it, you have people that want to question, and you have people that want to get out of there and on with their lives as quickly as possible.

It's incredible to think of a time when Juries consisted of twelve whits men, it would have taken a brave man to be a single disagreeing voice.

"""12 Angry Men"" A chamber film about self-discovery.

""They have twelve pieces of paper... Twelve chances to kill!"" - tagline and the only thing I knew about the film. And that's what I'd like to shoot!

I love when the essence of the film sounds in the ""background"". We watch the jury deliberate on whether the boy is guilty of murdering his father, and we see each character's soul unfold. Based on emotions, thinking about the case by the words of his life problems, almost every character builds a monument of his character and breaks it into pieces. Juror 9's monologue about an old man who, at 79 years old, just wants to be heard, gets me every time. And with all prof. Deformation, I forget that I'm watching a movie.

And if you watched the movie and are waiting for comments about the case itself, facts and evidence - I have nothing to say. Many people have already done it for me. I remembered only people who reveal the truth in themselves by spending an hour talking to strangers.

"This movie is *not* a courtroom (or jury room) drama. It's about how a jury room can become a sanctuary that changes the lives of the jurors. It heavily implies that any place could become a place of metamorphosis if we only dug deeper with each other regarding each other's thoughts and beliefs.

What seems to be a closed case slowly unravels through deeper discussion. In the beginning, 11-1 is the vote in favor of guilty, a vote to send an 18 year old to the electric chair for murdering his father. One juror thinks there should be more discussion. He stands up to a lot of ridicule, but perseveres and slowly has his doubts vindicated as more jurors notice fishy things about the case and change their votes.",thi movi courtroom juri room drama it juri room becom sanctuari chang live juror it heavili impli place could becom place metamorphosi dug deeper regard other thought belief what seem close case slowli unravel deeper discus in begin vote favor guilti vote send year old electr chair murder father one juror think discus he stand lot ridicul persever slowli doubt vindic juror notic fishi thing case chang vote,Neutral
"This movie came out of an era that I really loved, when ensemble acting was so strong. We had a whole group of character actors who really took seriously the smaller roles that they had. The direction by Sidney Lumet on this film is outstanding. To take the Henry Fonda character from the meek, inconsequential juror, simply putting forth a theory, to watching the other men slowly see his way of thinking, is subtlety at its best. Lee J. Cobb does his burn, done in by impatience and inconvenience. Pusing an agenda that fits only him. Underlying the entire plot is the defendant whom we never see but get to know through a slow, methodical, yet fascinating series of revelations. It's quiet, suspenseful, and human.",thi movi came era i realli love ensembl act strong we whole group charact actor realli took serious smaller role the direct sidney lumet film outstand to take henri fonda charact meek inconsequenti juror simpli put forth theori watch men slowli see way think subtleti best lee j cobb burn done impati inconveni puse agenda fit underli entir plot defend never see get know slow method yet fascin seri revel it quiet suspens human,Positive
"A dissenting juror (Henry Fonda) in a murder trial slowly manages to convince the others (Jack Klugman , Martin Balsam , Jack Warden , Lee. J. Cobb , Ed Begley , E.G. Marshall , Robert Webber , among others) that the case is not as obviously clear as it seemed in court. As Juror #8 holds out with a verdict of not guilty, thus setting the stage for arguments and reasons why or why not the boy may be guilty . As he desperately seeks to convince his eleven peers to reconsider their hast conviction of a boy framed of murdering . As 12 jurors are struggling to decide the fate of a teenager who allegedly killed his father .

Made for television classic about twelve jurors quick to condemn a youth on trial for murdering his father before reviewing the evidence. Though the whole movie is set in a jury room it never lacks for taut , suspense , intrigue and inspired direction . The struggle behind closed doors is tense , charged and riveting . Reginald Rose's brilliant TV play script was left virtually intact in its move to feature film. This famous play from the 'Golden Age of Television' was splendidly directed by Sidney Lumet with an extraordinary plethora of actors who give magnificent performances .Because the painstaking rehearsals for the film lasted an exhausting two weeks, filming had to be completed in an unprecedented 21 days and shot in a total of 365 separate takes. However, nowadays none of the twelve stars are still alive . The acting level of the cast during some of the intense discussions and debates almost bursts in the screen . The movie is commonly used in business schools and workshops to illustrate team dynamics and conflict resolution techniques. Nominated for 3 Oscars , another 16 wins & 6 nominations ; the film lost out in all its categories to The Bridge on the River Kwai . It ranked #2 on the American Film Institute's list of the 10 greatest films in the genre ""Courtroom Drama"".

This Lumet's impressive debut was followed by a remake made for cable TV (1997) , a contemporized rendition of the memorable tale whose script has been slightly updated but the premise is the same , it was directed by William Friedkin with a formidable cast such as William L. Petersen, Edward James Olmos, Hume Cronyn, James Gandolfini, Dorian Harewood, Ossie Davis, and Courtney B. Vance , George C. Scott , Armin Mueller-Stahl , Tony Danza and Jack Lemmon takes on the voice of dissent , the Fonda role .

It's not just because it is a classic black and white movie, I love that about it. It's a Wonderful Life blows this away.

"A young ethnic kid from a rough area is up on a murder charge and to the jury of twelve men, it all seems a fairly open and shut case. So all are surprised when the votes come back with one ""not guilty"" in the pack. Juror #8 maintains he holds a reasonable doubt, much to the frustration of the rest of the group. The stalemate forces a debate over the details of the case which sees each man questioning others and themselves for their motivations and decisions. The heat in the room and the passage of time sees tensions rising by the minute.

I'm not a massive fan of the ""Movie You Must See"" podcast crew because they mostly tend to discuss the events in a film rather than really critiquing or reviewing it (although at times this ""mates in a pub"" approach is OK). Anyway, one of the advantages of having anyone pointing out ""films you should see"" is that it reminds you that you should these films. So it was for me as I listened to 12 Angry Men and realised that not only had I never reviewed it but that I had not actually watched it for many years. Of course mentally I knew it was a ""classic"" but did I really understand why it was? So when it came on television recently I watched it again with new eyes.

The films moves right into the jury room and pretty much this room is all we have for the duration. Initially the script does really well to have the viewer side with the majority because in the discussions the evidence does seem very clear cut and #8's doubts seem so general and non-specific. This is a good way to start because it means the viewer also has to question and we are taken along the journey just like the men in the jury. Gradually we get into the detail and doubts are tweaked out  not to the point of solving the crime because that is not what it is about but it is done in a way that is interesting and engaging. It is not perfect in this regards though because some of the jumps are big, some of the assumptions are stretching and some of the knowledge in the room is a little too convenient. However what weaknesses there are in the material are covered by the fact that the delivery is roundly quite brilliant.

Lumet directions from within the room and makes great use of such a small space. It feels like it could be a play (not sure if it was or not) but Lumet prevents this just feeling like filmed theatre. The camera captures the room, sticks close to characters, moves around, in and out accordingly and it never feels stiff. This aids the sense of tension from the audience point of view as we are not just left watching the room so much as being in it. The ensemble cast are another big factor in this delivery as they all deliver. On the surface of it the characters could easily be labelled ""racist"", ""old"", ""naïve"", ""angry"" and so on but the actors don't let themselves be that basic and they also do a good job of pacing the building resentment and tension in the room to be convincing. Fonda maybe has ""top-billing"" but he does have the least showy role, leading those into his corner. Cobb and Begley have good turns as the anger of the room but everyone plays their parts very well. OK Balsam, Webber and Voskovec come out the least memorable of the lot but this is understandable when viewed beside such sterling turns from Fielder, Klugman, Warden, Sweeney and Marshall. There really isn't a weak link in the room.

With modern cynical eyes it is perhaps totally hard to accept the film for its praise of the jury system and I do agree with the ""MYMS"" group when they made reference to the moment in H:LOTS which is essentially the bitter reverse of this film. However this slightly flag-waving stuff is covered by the delivery being as strong and as well paced as it is. Overall then this is an eminently watchable film and I can understand why it is so well regarded. The material and message may not be note-perfect but the delivery is brilliant across the board and it is one that I could easily return to again and again and still get pleasure out of how well it is all done.",a young ethnic kid rough area murder charg juri twelv men seem fairli open shut case so surpris vote come back one guilti pack juror maintain hold reason doubt much frustrat rest group the stalem forc debat detail case see man question other motiv decis the heat room passag time see tension rise minut im massiv fan movi you must see podcast crew mostli tend discus event film rather realli critiqu review although time mate pub approach ok anyway one advantag anyon point film see remind film so i listen angri men realis i never review i actual watch mani year of cours mental i knew classic i realli understand so came televis recent i watch new eye the film move right juri room pretti much room durat initi script realli well viewer side major discus evid seem clear cut doubt seem gener nonspecif thi good way start mean viewer also question taken along journey like men juri gradual get detail doubt tweak point solv crime done way interest engag it perfect regard though jump big assumpt stretch knowledg room littl conveni howev weak materi cover fact deliveri roundli quit brilliant lumet direct within room make great use small space it feel like could play sure lumet prevent feel like film theatr the camera captur room stick close charact move around accordingli never feel stiff thi aid sen tension audienc point view left watch room much the ensembl cast anoth big factor deliveri deliv on surfac charact could easili label racist old naïv angri actor dont let basic also good job pace build resent tension room convinc fonda mayb topbil least showi role lead corner cobb begley good turn anger room everyon play part well ok balsam webber voskovec come least memor lot understand view besid sterl turn fielder klugman warden sweeney marshal there realli isnt weak link room with modern cynic eye perhap total hard accept film prais juri system i agre mym group made refer moment hlot essenti bitter revers film howev slightli flagwav stuff cover deliveri strong well pace overal emin watchabl film i understand well regard the materi messag may noteperfect deliveri brilliant across board one i could easili return still get pleasur well done,Positive

"... the main flaw being that everybody brings their own life experiences and history into the jury room with them, no matter how hard they try to be impartial.

Here you have a trial of a young boy who supposedly stabbed his father to death. When the jurors go back to deliberate on the case, ALL but one lone man played with a quiet courage by Henry Fonda states guilty and the rest of the film is about trying to get them to his side. Quite an amazing movie if you ask me. Fonda's case is not that the boy is innocent, but that the threshold of reasonable doubt has not been reached. The trick in this film is that it never leaves the jury room. You have no idea of what the defendant, the prosecuting attorney, or the defense attorney were like other than retroactively through the words of the jurors.

Writing this good just can't be ignored. Reginald Rose's screenplay is absolutely brilliant. Not only are the characters of twelve individuals indelibly implanted in your brain within the limited time span of about 100 minutes, but Rose accomplishes this feat without undue speechifying or pontificating about injustice or the failures of the jury system or expositional dialogue. The characters personalities come out in the course of the film and are not ""set up"" in the first half hour, (as in having the jurors explain to each other what their occupations and backgrounds are) as is the case with mediocre screenplays. As for the acting it is true ensemble greatness. All twelve cast members are excellent, although if you put a gun to my head and forced me to say who was best I'd express a partiality for Lee J Cobb as the toughest nut to crack for acquittal and E. G. Marshall as a juror who is all logic and no emotion other than arrogance. And Sidney Lumet's first film just may be his most fast paced. The hundred minutes whiz by! Not a dull stretch to be seen anywhere.

And yes, these are twelve white men judging a Puerto Rican boy, and yes Henry Fonda violated many classic rules of jury behavior when he introduced items into the discussion that were not official evidence, but this was 60 years ago and it IS a movie. So just suspend your beliefs and try to enjoy the art of the thing -the riveting dialogue, the character studies that don't choke each other out, and the brilliant camera-work that manages to make the room seem increasingly smaller so that you can appreciate the claustrophobia that must be setting in with the jurors as deliberations wear on and get more heated.",main flaw everybodi bring life experi histori juri room matter hard tri imparti here trial young boy supposedli stab father death when juror go back deliber case all one lone man play quiet courag henri fonda state guilti rest film tri get side quit amaz movi ask fonda case boy innoc threshold reason doubt reach the trick film never leav juri room you idea defend prosecut attorney defens attorney like retroact word juror write good cant ignor reginald rose screenplay absolut brilliant not charact twelv individu indel implant brain within limit time span minut rose accomplish feat without undu speechifi pontif injustic failur juri system exposit dialogu the charact person come cours film set first half hour juror explain occup background case mediocr screenplay a act true ensembl great all twelv cast member excel although put gun head forc say best id express partial lee j cobb toughest nut crack acquitt e g marshal juror logic emot arrog and sidney lumet first film may fast pace the hundr minut whiz not dull stretch seen anywher and ye twelv white men judg puerto rican boy ye henri fonda violat mani classic rule juri behavior introduc item discus offici evid year ago is movi so suspend belief tri enjoy art thing rivet dialogu charact studi dont choke brilliant camerawork manag make room seem increasingli smaller appreci claustrophobia must set juror deliber wear get heat,Positive

"So simple yet so brilliant, 12 ANGRY MEN is not to be missed. It's the tale of the meticulous Mr. Davis, a juror not quite convinced of a murder suspect's guilt despite what appears to be overwhelming evidence. His questions gradually persuade his fellow jurors that things aren't always as open-and-shut as they might seem.

One of the great all-time ensemble casts highlights 12 ANGRY MEN. Henry Fonda is superb as the hardcore skeptic... but then again, everyone is superb, from Joseph Sweeney as the eldest juror to E.G. Marshall as the no-nonsense Juror #4. Anytime a film set almost exclusively at a single cramped table in a single cramped room can spellbound the viewer, you know you've got first-rate actors. The clever, colorful dialog is a treat as well.

Yet the strongest asset of 12 ANGRY MEN is the demands it makes of the viewer to think critically. Initially we are like most of the jurors, curious as to how Fonda can be so naive to think the young suspect may be innocent. But he gradually pulls us into his line of reasoning, challenging our assumptions and finding fault with the supposed facts. By the film's end, we're left wondering how we could have been so narrow-minded just 90 minutes earlier.

As sharp as what's on screen is, 12 ANGRY MEN is equally smart for what it does not show. Many of today's filmgoers would demand flashback sequences to depict what the characters describe. They would want to get to know the accused killer so they could judge him for themselves. They would want more action, more pizazz, and changes of scenery. Yet it's precisely the film's refusal to do any of this that makes it work so well. The viewer is effectively the 13th juror with nothing but recollections of testimony to go on. Our imaginations are free to create a picture of the alleged murder, just as we would have to as part of the jury.

12 ANGRY MEN is often cited as one of the greatest films ever. It's a verdict that is well deserved.",so simpl yet brilliant angri men miss it tale meticul mr davi juror quit convinc murder suspect guilt despit appear overwhelm evid hi question gradual persuad fellow juror thing arent alway openandshut might seem one great alltim ensembl cast highlight angri men henri fonda superb hardcor skeptic everyon superb joseph sweeney eldest juror eg marshal nononsens juror anytim film set almost exclus singl cramp tabl singl cramp room spellbound viewer know youv got firstrat actor the clever color dialog treat well yet strongest asset angri men demand make viewer think critic initi like juror curiou fonda naiv think young suspect may innoc but gradual pull u line reason challeng assumpt find fault suppos fact by film end left wonder could narrowmind minut earlier a sharp what screen angri men equal smart show mani today filmgoer would demand flashback sequenc depict charact describ they would want get know accus killer could judg they would want action pizazz chang sceneri yet precis film refus make work well the viewer effect th juror noth recollect testimoni go our imagin free creat pictur alleg murder would part juri angri men often cite one greatest film ever it verdict well deserv,Positive
"And that what I did, I friend of mine has been annoying me about seeing this film and since the film is not a long one (about 90 minutes) I said why not, and then after just 30 minutes I decided to put this film on the very top of my all time favorite film list.

The fact that the film has been shot in one room blew my mind away, seems very easy to direct huh? But with a superb script and acting Sidney Lumet created one of the greatest films ever made if not the greatest.

The dialogue is realistic and so sharp with a brilliant acting from Henry Fonda and Lee J.Cobb, I feel this film is still underrated even in IMDb rankings.

"Twelve jurors deliberate the case of an 18-year-old impoverished youth accused of stabbing his father to death. While 11 Jurors are immediately in favor of a ""guilty"" verdict with Juror #3 (Lee J. Cobb) the loudest supporter, one juror, Juror #8 (Henry Fonda), stands as the lone ""Not Guilty"" verdict and feels they should discuss the case rather than immediately render a verdict. As deliberations commence in the sweltering jury room during a heat wave positions and assumptions are challenged as jurors find their pre-conceived notions and personal prejudices challenged by new lights shone on the facts, witnesses and evidence.

12 Angry Men is an adaptation of the 1954 television play Twelve Angry Men written by Reginald Rose for anthology series Studio One. The success of the teleplay resulted in stage adaptations, which in turn lead to a theatrical adaptation in 1957 produced by Henry Fonda. The movie also became the directorial debut of Sidney Lumet who had done TV work for both Studio One and The Alcoa Hour. While the movie received critical acclaim including Academy Award nominations for Best Picture, Best Director, and Best Adapted Screenplay, the movie was a box office disappointment in the US (but did better internationally) due to the advent of color and widescreen productions and it wouldn't be until television airings the film would find an audience. 12 Angry Men has ingrained itself in pop culture with all manner of references, allusions, and parodies of the work still being made to this day as well as re-adaptations both domestically and abroad. Rightly so, because while 12 Angry Men's premise is very simple, it's filled with all manner of complex characters we get to know over the course of its 90 minute runtime.

The movie is essentially a chamber piece. Aside from scenes at the opening and closing of the movie, once we're in that jury room with our collection of actors featuring E. G. Marshall, Martin Baslam, and John Fiedler just to name a few we don't leave and the actors all give weight and presence to their characters so we feel like we get to know their personalities and histories and they play well off each other as tensions escalate. The movie takes a detached view of the murder case with most of the elements conveyed to us from second hand recounts of eyewitness statements leaving the audience very much in the position of determining whether or not the accused is in fact guilty with the same unreliable evidence.

12 Angry Men remains a solid chamber drama with great performances from its ensemble and timeless themes. Henry Fonda gives a great performance, but it wouldn't stand out as much without the great assortment of other actors he plays off of. It's a classic for a reason.",twelv juror deliber case yearold impoverish youth accus stab father death while juror immedi favor guilti verdict juror lee j cobb loudest support one juror juror henri fonda stand lone not guilti verdict feel discus case rather immedi render verdict a deliber commenc swelter juri room heat wave posit assumpt challeng juror find preconceiv notion person prejudic challeng new light shone fact wit evid angri men adapt televis play twelv angri men written reginald rose antholog seri studio one the success teleplay result stage adapt turn lead theatric adapt produc henri fonda the movi also becam directori debut sidney lumet done tv work studio one the alcoa hour while movi receiv critic acclaim includ academi award nomin best pictur best director best adapt screenplay movi box offic disappoint u better intern due advent color widescreen product wouldnt televis air film would find audienc angri men ingrain pop cultur manner refer allus parodi work still made day well readapt domest abroad rightli angri men premis simpl fill manner complex charact get know cours minut runtim the movi essenti chamber piec asid scene open close movi juri room collect actor featur e g marshal martin baslam john fiedler name dont leav actor give weight presenc charact feel like get know person histori play well tension escal the movi take detach view murder case element convey u second hand recount eyewit statement leav audienc much posit determin whether accus fact guilti unreli evid angri men remain solid chamber drama great perform ensembl timeless theme henri fonda give great perform wouldnt stand much without great assort actor play it classic reason,Positive

"I'm going to be contrary. The movie is about as preachy as you can get. The 12 jurors are all cartoonish stereotypes, locked into their predictable characters. The unlikeable characters, of course, all make vacuous, absurd arguments for there position, while yelling and gesticulating. The characters we're supposed to like all make calm, reasonable arguments.

The morality is laid out in stark black and white. No grey, no ambiguity, no difficult choices. Me, I like a movie with a dilemma, and some ""lesser of two evils"" choices. Each character should also be a mixture of good and bad and grey.

Don't you get tired of Hollywood clonking you over the head with a moral lesson?

"When I found this movie in the ""Top 250"" in such a high position, i was quite surprised, especially when I realized that 90% of the movie happens in a room, and that's a risk, Because you need the characters to be quite flashy and that the script that is delivered has to be very entertaining not to be bored, and it goes that this movie does not bore you, it keeps you intrigued by the case that is, the juries are very Outstanding, I will not do a long review, it is only a recommendation of a person who doubted much of a movie of this style and was fascinated.

(It is also an important fact to say that I am not a man very interested in crime issues, nor very knowledgeable about it.)

The film deals with the case of a young man who is being blamed for murder and the jury must decide whether to give the maximum penalty or not. It is a plot that looks pretty simple, noting that this movie is based on a play from what I understand. What I called a lot of the movie is the atmosphere that you are given in the room, a hot day, 12 tired men and some of them want to leave as quickly as caring the sentence really. This film I liked also because it deals with quite interesting subjects: doubt, as our experience affects us in our decisions, go, subjects that look in perspective rather boring (Thinking of someone who only wants to watch a movie and not a moral debate) but that Are developed so well and subtly that you do not feel that you are giving a speech, you feel that you are watching a movie with interesting themes.

"Twelve Angry Men was a very good movie, with good dialogue and an excellent cast. The cast had a lot of opposite personalities which made the dynamics on the movie very interesting to watch. Although the audio was not as good as present day films and the dialogue was occasionally slow, the tension and interplay of the jurors quickly picked up again and kept your interest in the movie. It was amazing how one by one Henry Ford's character was able to convert all the other jurors over to a non-guilty verdict. It was really scary how all of the other 11 jurors wanted to vote guilty just to get the trial over with because they didn't want to be stuck at the courthouse. They all had better things to do, like go to a baseball game or visit with the friends and they didn't want to look to closely at the accuracy of the testimony, but Henry Ford's character made them take the time to think it through. Watching the movie Twelve Angry Men was much better than reading the written play because you could really see all the characters more clearly. The emotions, the tension and the frustration was so much more obvious in the film and came across so much more strongly than it did in written form.

"A lot has already been said about this masterpiece, thus it seems almost unnecessary to praise its many qualities. There two elements in particular, though, which set it apart from other classics.

One is how it showcases the sheer power of good screenplay and acting. There's no need for special effects, stunning cinematography or forced plot twists to create an intelligent and extremely entertaining film. Director Sidney Lumet only needed one room, twelve good actors and a timeless issue. With twelve distinctive characters, there are endless possibilities for interaction between them: what would happen if an extremely rigorous man had to cooperate with someone who'd rather play tic-tac-toe? Or an old man who finds himself ignored by many with a young businessman who costantly talks about his job?

The second aspect is how, despite being more than sixty years old, this movie's characters are incredibly relatable. Everyone has their biases, some are more emotional, some calmer, some more rigorous, some more chaotic. It is safe to say that we all now at least someone who resembles each of the twelve angry men. What is extraordinary is that this incredibly poignant characterisation is achieved with little more than an hour and a half for twelve distinct jurors, and all of them are memorable.

"The unsurpassed character studies of the ""12 Angry Men"" would almost make a movie worth seeing even if it had little else to offer. This is also a very good drama that uses everything it has to good advantage. The cast and director Sidney Lumet all do a fine job of sketching each character efficiently and memorably. Every character is important, and almost every line serves a purpose.

One interesting thing about the story is that the trial per se is almost not even particularly important. The jury setting is really just a stylized way of high-lighting many aspects of human nature and human interaction, and in particular, the varied ways that different persons respond in situations where their options are limited. The characters have a wide and well-chosen diversity of personalities and opinions, and each one's temperament and attitudes are developed as things proceed.

In performing this kind of material, it's important for the actors not to overdo it, or else the believability suffers. It's also a challenge to keep things interesting when the settings and props are so limited. But everything works very well here, and it is a credit to everyone involved.",the unsurpass charact studi angri men would almost make movi worth see even littl el offer thi also good drama use everyth good advantag the cast director sidney lumet fine job sketch charact effici memor everi charact import almost everi line serv purpos one interest thing stori trial per se almost even particularli import the juri set realli styliz way highlight mani aspect human natur human interact particular vari way differ person respond situat option limit the charact wide wellchosen diver person opinion one tempera attitud develop thing proceed in perform kind materi import actor overdo el believ suffer it also challeng keep thing interest set prop limit but everyth work well credit everyon involv,Positive
"I personally think the movie Twelve Angry Men is better then the play. Not just for the reasons that I like retro movies or that the acting was so bad it was kind-of funny. But for the fact that the movies plot connected to me in a way I don't think it connected with other people. Because I have a thing for law and I think that this plot and this movie/play showed me a different side of law that isn't really talked about, but is a big part of the process. The reason I picked the movie over the play was that I guess my era is used and is attracted to movies more then to reading also that it was funny that the whole movie was 90 minutes of twelve men sitting in one room which got really boring but not as boring as the play. This might not be the best. Another reason I don't like the play as much as the movie is that. I don't think everyone was interested as I was and didn't really follow along and when it came to their part to read I was ready and they weren't ready to read which was really boring. Because yo9u would have to wait for them and I think I fell asleep a couple times. But overall the movie was WAY better then the play. If you're into law I think it's a must see.

"12 Angry Men (1957) is a movie I recently watched for the first time in a long time on Tubi. The storyline follows a jury trying a case for murder where everyone agrees but one person. That one person discusses the case with the jury and explains why he doesn't agree based on the evidence. Will the jurors change their mind and align with the man or will it be a hung jury?

This movie is directed by Sidney Lumet (Before the Devil Know You're Dead) and stars Henry Fonda (The Wrong Man), Lee J. Cobb (On the Waterfront), Jack Warden (Heaven Can Wait), Edward Binns (Patton), Martin Balsam (Psycho) and E. G. Marshall (Creepshow).

The storyline for this picture is very smart and unique. The acting and dialogue is out of this world and the storyline is well paced and unfolds well. The acting is splendid and Fonda and Cobb's back and forth is very good. There are many unpredictable elements. Some of the sequences felt unrealistic; but overall, it was still an entertaining watch.

"At risk of repeating myself a few words in, let's not bury the lede: '12 angry men' is one of the greatest movies that will ever be made.

This film's reputation far precedes it, and it's taken me far too long to actually get around to watching it. It has far exceeded all possible expectations. The premise is so simple, and the plot is no more than a tracing of the jury's discussion, but those bare-bones elements are all that is necessary to produce a stunning, moving picture. Quintessential, paramount themes include and are not limited to prejudice and confirmation bias; redirected anger, ego, and inflated notions of masculinity; careful deliberation and critical thinking; reason, mob rule, and the former prevailing over the latter; loud mouths, empty heads, and hot tempers; presumption of innocence, the dire importance of ""doubt,"" due process, democracy, justice - and still more. It's a picture that is at times infuriating, sad, inspiring, or thought-provoking, and lively and stimulating at all points, while nonetheless spending 97% of its length within a single room. For all the rightly acclaimed features that have ever been made, precious few immediately make so staggering and lasting an impact as this. '12 angry men' is truly perfect.

The dialogue and scene writing in Reginald Rose's screenplay is ""everything,"" as the youths say. Even within a singular space these manage to be rich, vibrant, and dynamic, carrying a dazzling array of ideas, moods, and flavors. Though of a completely different genre, only one other picture (Tilman Singer's 2018 indie horror flick 'Luz') readily comes to mind as having achieved anything like the same effect of communicating a cohesive, whole narrative without actively filming that which is being described. It's the screenwriting equivalent of an ice cream cone that simultaneously embodies one's every favorite flavor, even those that ordinarily conflict and weren't scooped. The progression of the jurors' heated conversation is a stroke of brilliance, twisting and shifting with fiery passion and steadfast willfulness that roundly impresses. Just as notable is that '12 angry men' declines additional amplifying embellishments (e.g. A reveal that a juror is on the take) as we would expect of most courtroom dramas: this is the story of twelve men honoring their ""civil responsibility,"" and nothing more. And that is most assuredly all it needs to be.

Rose's characters represent a noteworthy (if entirely white and male) diversity of backgrounds, values, beliefs, and preconceptions. One could only imagine the fireworks that may ensue from a 21st century remake that reflects genuine, realistic diversity, but still this 50s rendition is enough without it. There is depth and complexity to each of the jurors that is wonderfully gratifying as a viewer - and the cast is utterly extraordinary in breathing life into them all. With character comportment ranging from calm and collected, to brash and volatile, and everything in between, every actor on hand is given stupendous opportunity to illustrate their skill, and they definitely do. Each individual performance is just magnificent as anything else in '12 angry men,' and marked with exquisite range, nuance, strength and force of personality, and physicality that turns one sweltering room into a blast furnace of deeply absorbing drama. I could name the actors one by one, but it's just as easy to scroll through the cast list - from one to the next, they are tremendous.

It would be very easy to speak at greater length about the resounding triumph of cinema '12 angry men' is, but there would come a point where one only talking in circles. Suffice to say that it's near-universal acclaim and high regard is absolutely deserved; I feel like a fool for having taken so long to ever watch it, and for the mere thought that it wouldn't hold up. Sixty-five years later this remains a masterful drama that demands to be seen wherever you may have the opportunity.",at risk repeat word let buri lede angri men one greatest movi ever made thi film reput far preced taken far long actual get around watch it far exceed possibl expect the premis simpl plot trace juri discus barebon element necessari produc stun move pictur quintessenti paramount theme includ limit prejudic confirm bia redirect anger ego inflat notion masculin care deliber critic think reason mob rule former prevail latter loud mouth empti head hot temper presumpt innoc dire import doubt due process democraci justic still it pictur time infuri sad inspir thoughtprovok live stimul point nonetheless spend length within singl room for rightli acclaim featur ever made preciou immedi make stagger last impact angri men truli perfect the dialogu scene write reginald rose screenplay everyth youth say even within singular space manag rich vibrant dynam carri dazzl array idea mood flavor though complet differ genr one pictur tilman singer indi horror flick luz readili come mind achiev anyth like effect commun cohes whole narr without activ film describ it screenwrit equival ice cream cone simultan embodi one everi favorit flavor even ordinarili conflict werent scoop the progress juror heat convers stroke brillianc twist shift fieri passion steadfast will roundli impress just notabl angri men declin addit amplifi embellish eg a reveal juror take would expect courtroom drama stori twelv men honor civil respons noth and assuredli need rose charact repres noteworthi entir white male diver background valu belief preconcept one could imagin firework may ensu st centuri remak reflect genuin realist diver still rendit enough without there depth complex juror wonder gratifi viewer cast utterli extraordinari breath life with charact comport rang calm collect brash volatil everyth everi actor hand given stupend opportun illustr skill definit each individu perform magnific anyth el angri men mark exquisit rang nuanc strength forc person physic turn one swelter room blast furnac deepli absorb drama i could name actor one one easi scroll cast list one next tremend it would easi speak greater length resound triumph cinema angri men would come point one talk circl suffic say nearunivers acclaim high regard absolut deserv i feel like fool taken long ever watch mere thought wouldnt hold sixtyf year later remain master drama demand seen wherev may opportun,Positive
"I have only seen this movie once, but it forever lives in my mind. I would very much like to own it on DVD soon.

The movie is over 60 years old but it still holds up today because of the tight-knit set and simple story. Some of the performances are still unsurpassed in regards to most of the classic cinema I have seen.

It is highly awarded/honored amongst the film society, and I recommend it to everyone because it is a classic and it has some of the most profound scenes you'll see from a movie even with little to no extreme action, gimmicks, etc.

Just great acting, a simple but profound story, excellent directing, good suspense, and more...

"12 Angry Men is a 1957 American drama film with elements of film noir, adapted from a teleplay of the same name by Reginald Rose. Written and co-produced by Rose himself and directed by Sidney Lumet, this trial film tells the story of a jury made up of 12 men as they deliberate the guilt or acquittal of a defendant on the basis of reasonable doubt. In the United States, a verdict in most criminal trials by jury must be unanimous. The film is notable for its almost exclusive use of one set: with the exception of the film's opening, which begins outside on the steps of the courthouse followed by the judge's final instructions to the jury before retiring, two short scenes in an adjoining washroom, and a brief final scene on the courthouse steps, the entire film takes place in the jury room. The total time spent outside the jury room is three minutes out of the full 96 minutes of the film.

12 Angry Men explores many techniques of consensus-building, and the difficulties encountered in the process, among a group of men whose range of personalities adds intensity and conflict. No names are used in the film: the jury members are identified by number until two of them exchange names at the very end, the defendant is referred to as ""the boy"", and the witnesses as ""the old man"" and ""the lady across the street"".

In 2007, 12 Angry Men was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being ""culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant"" and is often seen as one of the greatest films ever made.",angri men american drama film element film noir adapt teleplay name reginald rose written coproduc rose direct sidney lumet trial film tell stori juri made men deliber guilt acquitt defend basi reason doubt in unit state verdict crimin trial juri must unanim the film notabl almost exclus use one set except film open begin outsid step courthous follow judg final instruct juri retir two short scene adjoin washroom brief final scene courthous step entir film take place juri room the total time spent outsid juri room three minut full minut film angri men explor mani techniqu consensusbuild difficulti encount process among group men whose rang person add intens conflict no name use film juri member identifi number two exchang name end defend refer boy wit old man ladi across street in angri men select preserv unit state nation film registri librari congress cultur histor aesthet signific often seen one greatest film ever made,Neutral
"The third best movie I saw in a live movie at all levels after the first ten minutes, the movie attracted me a lot, before I watched the movie I was afraid that the movie was without events and it was in one room, but I liked the movie I liked it very much, I liked most of the jurors, especially Juror No. Most of the actors played their roles excellently, they were not actors while I was watching the movie and the best actor in the movie was Lee J. Cobb. His performance was very impressive.

And at the same time you are finding out more about the entire murder case, and how racism and sterotypes can break a good democracy. I really do like the touches like how the camera zooms in gardually over time. With really nice actors with somewhat conving diolog it makes you want to watch till the end.

"The first time I discovered IMDB's top 250 list, I noticed that ""12 Angry Men"" was the 5th best movie ever. I had heard of the film but only the version starring Jack Lemmon from 1997. After some research, I realized this film has one of the strongest casts of any movie ever released. Its cast has much success outside of this film. Out of the 12 jurors, five nominations for Oscars, three won Oscars, seven received an Emmy nomination, and six received a Golden Globe nomination. Henry Fonda, who is the film's lead actor, is one of my favorites of all time. His film ""On Golden Pond"" is a film that I view as perfection. Fond's performance in this film is one of the finest of his career.

This film also is directed by Sidney Lumet, who made another favorite movie of mine ""Murder on the Orient Express."" This film is one of those films that is pretty much perfect. I don't love it as much as ""Murder on the Orient Express,"" but I love it more than any other courtroom drama. It's better than my other two favorite courtroom dramas, ""My Cousin Vinny"" and ""The People vs. Larry Flynt."" I think it's much better than the highly overrated ""To Kil a Mockingbird."" I don't see what people see in that film. I think it's a six.

In Conclusion. This film is not the best Henry Fonda film (On Golden Pond). This film is not the best Sidney Lumet film (Murder on the Orient Express). It's not even the best Martin Balsam (Juror #1) film (Psycho). But it's one of my favorite films, Easily a 10/10.",the first time i discov imdb top list i notic angri men th best movi ever i heard film version star jack lemmon after research i realiz film one strongest cast movi ever releas it cast much success outsid film out juror five nomin oscar three oscar seven receiv emmi nomin six receiv golden globe nomin henri fonda film lead actor one favorit time hi film on golden pond film i view perfect fond perform film one finest career thi film also direct sidney lumet made anoth favorit movi mine murder orient express thi film one film pretti much perfect i dont love much murder orient express i love courtroom drama it better two favorit courtroom drama my cousin vinni the peopl v larri flynt i think much better highli overr to kil mockingbird i dont see peopl see film i think six in conclus thi film best henri fonda film on golden pond thi film best sidney lumet film murder orient express it even best martin balsam juror film psycho but one favorit film easili,Positive
"I hope that people don't see the score without reading the reviews as much as I think they do. Believe me, I find that you can still enjoy a movie, even respect it, without liking it. This is definitely the case with 12 Angry men. While I can enjoy the experience of watching the film, I've come to the rather unpopular opinion that this is not a great film. 12 Angry men works far better as a stage play, than a movie. As a film, it's quit uninspired and lacking emotion. The dialogue being as uninteresting as your least favorite math class, this is only accentuated by the fact that this film attempts to carry itself on dialogue and performance. Another problem comes right from the name itself; 12. The 12 angry men in the film are mostly indiscernible from each other, excluding a select few. While on stage the characters can show a lot of complexity with each actor playing off of each others emotions and bringing something new to performances each night, the film is lacking in character development.",i hope peopl dont see score without read review much i think believ i find still enjoy movi even respect without like thi definit case angri men while i enjoy experi watch film ive come rather unpopular opinion great film angri men work far better stage play movi a film quit uninspir lack emot the dialogu uninterest least favorit math class accentu fact film attempt carri dialogu perform anoth problem come right name the angri men film mostli indiscern exclud select while stage charact show lot complex actor play other emot bring someth new perform night film lack charact develop,Positive
"There's not much that can be said about 12 Angry Men apart from it being a very well made movie. It is ture that its plot is nothing special and it seems very boring at first but as you get deeper and deeper you start to enjoy it. Because the thing that makes this movie good is not some awesome and unique plot but the impressive dialogues. I actually think that this movie is a bit overrated but I have to admit that it has one of the best dialogues. These marvelous dialogues are the thing that makes this movie the masterpiece it is.

The acting is on an average level. The actors did a good job but I can't say that anyone of them did an outstanding performance. As for the cinematography it could've been better. I personally think that if they had shot this movie form different angles it would've looked more intriguing and intense. But still as I already said 12 Angry Men has a very well written script and that's enough for it to be called a good movie.",there much said angri men apart well made movi it ture plot noth special seem bore first get deeper deeper start enjoy becaus thing make movi good awesom uniqu plot impress dialogu i actual think movi bit overr i admit one best dialogu these marvel dialogu thing make movi masterpiec the act averag level the actor good job i cant say anyon outstand perform a cinematographi couldv better i person think shot movi form differ angl wouldv look intrigu intens but still i alreadi said angri men well written script that enough call good movi,Positive
"This is best movie for me. I love this movie. The film explores themes such as justice and the complexities of the system of judging a person.

"Juror #1, the foreman (Martin Balsam, football coach): ""Well, I won't be too technical, or make a long speech  it's just that it's a one-set film, so it's new and risky, because you know, dialogs are not enough, we need uh  the thrills  and it goes slowly in the beginning but progressively, it's like the jury room becomes smaller, and the faces bigger. I really felt the tense and suffocating atmosphere ... And what an explosive climax, I could hardly breathe  I know it's strange, but the direction, well, the movie is one hell of a thriller  I, well, my verdict is clear: GREAT MOVIE""

Juror #2 (John Fiedler, bank clerk): ""I don't know. It's an excellent film, served by great performances. Every character was convincing, so were their interactions. I can't find any flaw, for me, there's nothing to add, and nothing to remove. It is a GREAT MOVIE""

Juror #3 (Lee J. Cobb, businessman): ""I told you why this movie is great, it's just  thought provoking, everything and I mean everything looked like it would have been this kind of preachy film with a good-hearted hero and simple-minded antagonists who just want to be vindictive. But this is an intelligent film which, even at the end, makes you question if the kid is guilty or not. Because it has nothing to do with punishment, it's about justice ... without any prejudice, and that deserves respect, yes sir! No doubt for me  GREAT MOVIE""

Juror #4 (E.G. Marshall, stockbroker): ""First of all, it's an excellent examination of all the subtle nuances that enrich a male adult demography, played with such believability every one could identify with one of the jurors. Secondly, the writing was intellectually gripping and emotionally engaging and I would add: respectful of the viewer's intelligence. The direction was excellent and created a feeling of growing claustrophobia guided by a very clever use of focal lenses, a credit to Sidney Lumet. Last but not least, it's about the noble concept of justice and presumption of innocence: ""12 Angry Men"" delivers a brilliant, intelligent, and universally inspiring message. To conclude, I can say I had the privilege to watch a GREAT MOVIE""

Juror #5 (Jack Klugman, the man from the slum): ""What else to say? I second the idea that it's a powerful drama demonstrating how prejudices poison the heart of our civilization, and I believe this is one of the few films that should be screened everywhere in the world as a powerful lesson for tolerance. My verdict is: GREAT MOVIE""

Juror #6 (Edward Binns, painter): ""A movie that younger and future generations should watch and respect. These are movies with no special effects, no big-star cast, no big explosions, no flashy cars and no sexy girls. You have a honest, simple movie featuring ordinary men, but the result is so impacting it should be appreciated by any movie lover, regardless of his or her age. Anyway, GREAT MOVIE""

Juror #7 (Jack Warden, salesman): ""Come on, everyone is using big words and noble concepts, but for me, this movie is just damn entertaining. Hey admit it, the dialogs, the way opposite characters interact, create a lot of anxiety but is also very fun to watch, sometimes, well  I think you can say anything, but without entertainment, a film is worthless, and the movie could've been a bore, just all talk and no walk, but it wasn't, it worked for me ... GREAT MOVIE""

Juror #8 (Henry Fonda, architect): ""This movie invites us to explore our convictions and question the way they influence our judgments. Justice is done by men, blindly and implacably, this is why punishment must be beyond any doubt, and when you have what appears to be an open-and-shut case that progressively reveals some flaws as we go deeper in the subject, well, this says a lot about the negative impact of subjectivity when it comes to justice, and how we should be careful about the consequences of our thoughts, our words, our acts. ""12 Angry Men"" is a humanistic inspiration for those who have faith in justice. GREAT MOVIE""

Juror #9 (Joseph Sweeney, retired): ""This is a fantastic character study illustrating how convincingness is often driven by the personality. It's an incredible illustration of the way a few people can monopolize the talk and how a silent majority is eager to follow the ones who aggressively express their thoughts, and the courage it takes to be the lone dissenter and how using a constructive, polite and logical answer can destroy something taken for granted. While watching ""12 Angry Men"" I understood that a consensus, when rapidly built, means that the truth must be elsewhere. And one truth for sure, this is a GREAT MOVIE""

Juror #10 (Ed Begley, garage owner): ""I hate the patronizing way some left-wing good-hearted people adore this film, this has nothing to do with politics, truth or justice, it's about manipulation of your thoughts by pushing the right emotional button  you missed the point, and that's the beauty of the film, you're all easily fooled. Not for the reasons you think, but it's a GREAT MOVIE""

Juror #11 (Joseph Voskovek, watchmaker): ""No need to be American to appreciate the beauty of this film, it's about our deepest convictions. It's about the humanistic concept of reasonable doubt which can save even a guilty soul ... because life is valuable and justice is not vengeance. GREAT MOVIE""

Juror #12 (Robert Webber, advertising executive): ""Wow, what I can say, it's not an exact science you know  you can find a reason A to appreciate it, a reason B or C  let's just say that the 'sigma' of these reasons, explains why it's an incredible film and as my fellow jurors said, why ""12 Angry Men"" is a GREAT MOVIE""",juror foreman martin balsam footbal coach well i wont technic make long speech oneset film new riski know dialog enough need uh thrill goe slowli begin progress like juri room becom smaller face bigger i realli felt ten suffoc atmospher and explos climax i could hardli breath i know strang direct well movi one hell thriller i well verdict clear great movi juror john fiedler bank clerk i dont know it excel film serv great perform everi charact convinc interact i cant find flaw there noth add noth remov it great movi juror lee j cobb businessman i told movi great thought provok everyth i mean everyth look like would kind preachi film goodheart hero simplemind antagonist want vindict but intellig film even end make question kid guilti becaus noth punish justic without prejudic deserv respect ye sir no doubt great movi juror eg marshal stockbrok first excel examin subtl nuanc enrich male adult demographi play believ everi one could identifi one juror secondli write intellectu grip emot engag i would add respect viewer intellig the direct excel creat feel grow claustrophobia guid clever use focal lens credit sidney lumet last least nobl concept justic presumpt innoc angri men deliv brilliant intellig univers inspir messag to conclud i say i privileg watch great movi juror jack klugman man slum what el say i second idea power drama demonstr prejudic poison heart civil i believ one film screen everywher world power lesson toler my verdict great movi juror edward binn painter a movi younger futur gener watch respect these movi special effect bigstar cast big explos flashi car sexi girl you honest simpl movi featur ordinari men result impact appreci movi lover regardless age anyway great movi juror jack warden salesman come everyon use big word nobl concept movi damn entertain hey admit dialog way opposit charact interact creat lot anxieti also fun watch sometim well i think say anyth without entertain film worthless movi couldv bore talk walk wasnt work great movi juror henri fonda architect thi movi invit u explor convict question way influenc judgment justic done men blindli implac punish must beyond doubt appear openandshut case progress reveal flaw go deeper subject well say lot neg impact subject come justic care consequ thought word act angri men humanist inspir faith justic great movi juror joseph sweeney retir thi fantast charact studi illustr convincing often driven person it incred illustr way peopl monopol talk silent major eager follow one aggress express thought courag take lone dissent use construct polit logic answer destroy someth taken grant while watch angri men i understood consensu rapidli built mean truth must elsewher and one truth sure great movi juror ed begley garag owner i hate patron way leftw goodheart peopl ador film noth polit truth justic manipul thought push right emot button miss point that beauti film your easili fool not reason think great movi juror joseph voskovek watchmak no need american appreci beauti film deepest convict it humanist concept reason doubt save even guilti soul life valuabl justic vengeanc great movi juror robert webber advertis execut wow i say exact scienc know find reason a appreci reason b c let say sigma reason explain incred film fellow juror said angri men great movi,Positive
"A pure, simple, undeniable classic. This movie is a thoughtful, well shot, amazingly scripted, fantastically acted masterpiece. Even though the word masterpiece is often over-used (like genius) it certainly, and without dispute applies in this case. Sidney Lumet's directing is top-notch, and Henry Fonda is the still turning point of this small, microcosmic little world - his role has to be one of the most finely acted ever committed to film.

Set in an actual New York jury room, it's a claustrophobic, tightly confined set, where 12 very different men deliberate over the guilt of a young boy. Their prejudices, morals and personalities are thrown together and, sometimes violently, clash. Along with a great parallel commentary from the weather (at the beginning of the film, it's a stuffy, oppressive sweatbox, which becomes sidelined by a dark, stormy maelstrom outside the jury room) this is a fantastic film. You'd never think there were so many angles you could get from one single, uncomfortably confining room. Sidney Lumet's directing is amazing, as Fonda's chain-smkoing, softly spoken moralistic character could have been played so much darker; he manages to turn everyone around, slowly but surely, almost effortlessly converting even the most staunchly opposed and stoic juror - but he's not manipulative, sly or underhanded about it. He simply presents what is - he's the pure voice of reason, and he has some cracking lines. The other jurors are great, too. I'm sure we all know someone who fidgets through something important because they've got a football game starting in ten minutes - they all highlight broad generalisations of very human characters. I defy anyone not to find a character that illustrates someone they know in this motley crue.

"What a bloody stupid idea for a cinema film ! Adapt a teleplay set entirely in one studio bound location , written in real time with absolutely no cinema appeal whatsoever ! Me ? I wouldn`t have touched this script with a barge pole if I was a producer which just goes to show why - Only very very occasionally - some people deserve to be film producers while - Only very very occasionally - people like myself don`t . 12 ANGRY MEN is a masterpiece , maybe not in the way APOCALYPSE NOW or FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING are cinematic masterpieces , but it`s still a masterpiece of high drama

Despite being based on a play Lumet does bring some outstanding directorial flourishes to the film . Look at he scene where the camera cuts from one raised hand to another to an empty space that has a raised hand gingerly creeping into the frame , or the scene where the characters become more and more disgusted with Ed "" Know what I mean "" Begley`s reactionary diatribe . Please forgive Reginald Rose`s ever so slightly bleeding heart liberal subtext or a couple of unlikely occurances like the scene with the knife , or the fact that jury discussions are nothing like this in real life because even more thought went into this script as went into MEMENTO .

"You couldn't make make me sit through this one again!

Watching 12 stereotypes shaken together until the cream rises to the top is little better than watching water come to a boil. At first, the cold water is still and transparent, then tiny bubbles begin to form - yet the water is not even warm! It is the air coming out of solution! The bubbles grow larger and rise to the surface. Again, the water is clear, but movement can be detected. There are swirling convection currents forming. The water becomes hot. There is more and more movement, the surface of the water is clearly undulating, and the water is getting hotter. Bubbles again begin to form at the bottom of the pot. They expand and begin to rise, but collapse and disappear. The expansion and collapse of the water vapor creates noise and the pot begins to vibrate. Then traces of water vapor begin to rise from the rolling surface of the water. Finally, the bubbles of water vapor survive the journey to the surface and emerge - releasing steam to the air. How exciting!

"I saw this film for the first time a few months ago and i was automatically annoyed with myself for having not done so long before. To put short, this film is one of the best ever made and rightfully deserves its position on IMDBs top 250 list.

To be honest, there's not a lot that one can comment about the film. There are no special effects, dramatic monologues or defining scenes to discuss and really that's what makes this film the phenomenon that it is. It is quite easy to see where the film is going to go and how it is going to end early on but none of that really matters because excuse the sugary metaphor but it is the journey you embark on with the jurors, in particular Henry Fonda, that defines the film. The way in which each different aspect of the court case is re-evaluated is film heaven but also a hard hitter when reflecting on the seriousness that the film makes about judicial systems and the responsibility of juries to make thorough rational decisions.

If you had told me before the film that it was as near as makes no difference one scene with 12 men conversing for 100 minutes (or whatever), i would have kindly asked you if we could watch Die Hard instead, but oh what an ignorant error that would have been. 12 Angry Men is magnificent.",i saw film first time month ago automat annoy done long to put short film one best ever made right deserv posit imdb top list to honest there lot one comment film there special effect dramat monologu defin scene discus realli that make film phenomenon it quit easi see film go go go end earli none realli matter excus sugari metaphor journey embark juror particular henri fonda defin film the way differ aspect court case reevalu film heaven also hard hitter reflect serious film make judici system respons juri make thorough ration decis if told film near make differ one scene men convers minut whatev would kindli ask could watch die hard instead oh ignor error would angri men magnific,Positive
"In the days before cgi, massive hype, star-appeal, pseudo-mythic trilogies and all the other bumpf that hollywood tacks on to its product in order to make it sell, all it took to make a decent movie was to have a good script and cast, good direction and of course great acting.

These were (and still are) the only real ingredients which I'd say are essential for making a truly worthwhile movie.

"It's tough sometimes to translate a stage production- which 12 Angry Men essentially is- into a feature film, with in this case one cramped room and a dozen characters with totally varied ideals. In a way this is like the textbook example, however, of how to do a film like this. You see how the situation unfolds into something more, about the act of telling a story and finding all the pieces. That it has such a powerhouse of an ensemble doesn't hurt it at all, and the little surprises in how the casts acts and reacts works great on repeat viewings. The basic premise only needs brief mention, as the 12 men (totally angry may be disputed by some, though I'm sure not one is left without raising their voice), all white, are judging the case of a Hispanic charged with killing his father. The deliberation room becomes a kind of boiler room where Henry Fonda's juror #11, the only un-sure one, sets the stage for a something more to be revealed- human nature when on a judgment day, with all its intelligence, ignorance, hate, and seeking objectivism.

Sidney Lumet, on his very first feature-film, does a really professional (in a good way) job of directing the picture, by which a) letting the actors, who among the great lot include Lee J Cobb, John Fiedler, E.G. Marhall, Martin Balsam, Jack Klugman, Ed Begley, and in maybe the most under-rated role of the 'old man', Joseph Sweeney, just do their work and try to just make sure no one over-steps their ability in their strengths; b) using the atmosphere to high effect. Like he would later do with Network, Lumet uses the camera to add some level of subjectivity to the storytelling, being careful with choosing close-ups but using them very wisely (i.e. a surprise close-up on Sweeney), and here and there making it feel like the walls are just closing in a little more. But, at the same time, Lumet's making a studio picture, with the all-around good-guy Henry Fonda (in one of his best roles), and dealing with a story that's, when it comes down to it, just the details of a crime examined over. But the real strength of the film comes in a quality that it shares with Rashomon (different in structure to be sure), that the idea of looking for the truth is just a guise in a way to examine the people who are looking at what the truth is.

"12 Angry Men is as simple as it is profound, and as bare-boned as it is a showcase of true camera-work and directional complexity. It is as much a film about the justice system in America as it is a film about people; a film that lets the viewer into a single room for 90 minutes (the film moves forward quicker than real time) and examines the quirks, insecurities, prejudices and glaring background differences of twelve different characters.

The film begins in a courtroom as a murder case is coming to a close. The judge informs the twelve jurors of their duty as though it were just another day in his life, as though the defendant (an 18-year old street kid) has already been proved guilty. In general, nobody in the film expects the potential (and probable) difficulties that the viewer anticipates externally. It is an ""open and shut case"" as the remarkable, unnamed juror (played by Lee J. Cobb) states in the first ten minutes.

Of course it isn't, otherwise 12 Angry Men would be an ""open-and-shut"" film. Opening credits play over an empty room which gradually fills up as the jurors takes their seats and prepare for the ballot. Over this time, we see windows being opened, negotiations taking place and pleasantries exchanged. If these 12 men agree that the c12 Angry Men (1957) by Sidney Lumet - Unsung Filmsase presents enough evidence to show that the crime had in fact been committed, then the verdict will be guilty. But if there is any room for what the judge calls ""reasonable doubt"", then the verdict changes.

Each character in this film is entirely different. It almost feels as though each has been handpicked to take part in a sort of experiment – and it very much feels like we are watching one unfold. Each man represents something unalike. With one man's decision not to conform, or at least not to believe everything that was discussed in the courtroom, 12 Angry Men erupts. Gradually, we start to understand these men; first, we are let it on some of their social backgrounds – one is an immigrant (possibly Greek or French) and one admits to have grown up in the same conditions as the young defendant. Both men should be able to relate to the defendant in many ways – for a moment, we are afforded a glimpse at the defendant's face, an immigrant from an anonymous ghetto. Strangely, both men vote ""guilty"" without hesitation.

12 Angry Men (1957) by Sidney Lumet - Unsung FilmsHenry Fonda lets us in on his reason for disputing — he simply does not want to decide on a person's life in the space of five minutes. This is understandable; the viewer takes his side and so, it seems, does the filmmaker. But some of the jurors argue as though it were personal; as though the young man had slaughtered their own sons, daughters and wives. Some of the men, and most noticeably Cobb as juror no. 3, work themselves up into a blind fury.

As the film goes on, it becomes evident that the case was never as clear as the jurors had announced at the beginning. For some, the more reasonable and likable characters, it had simply been a case of accepting the evidence provided without questions. For others, assumptions had been made as a result of deep-rooted prejudices and massive complexes. While many change their minds with the influence of rational thought, some characters simply get angrier and more aggressive; two characters give away their racist views and the powerful scene that runs over the final ten minutes, works to reveal so much about the most moving and brilliant character portrayal in the film.

The happenings described in court unfold for a second time over the duration of 12 Angry Men. By the end, it as though we possess the same knowledge of what happened in the courtroom over the days of the trial, as the twelve men in the film. Helmed by Fonda, juror no. 8, the situation is played out again with incredible detail; every argument and theory presented to us is done so with such extreme care and passion. This is one of the film's that stay with you for a lifetime because its simplicity allows itself to be engraved in the mind, while the complexity of it demands that you make sure it is.",angri men simpl profound barebon showcas true camerawork direct complex it much film justic system america film peopl film let viewer singl room minut film move forward quicker real time examin quirk insecur prejudic glare background differ twelv differ charact the film begin courtroom murder case come close the judg inform twelv juror duti though anoth day life though defend year old street kid alreadi prove guilti in gener nobodi film expect potenti probabl difficulti viewer anticip extern it open shut case remark unnam juror play lee j cobb state first ten minut of cours isnt otherwis angri men would openandshut film open credit play empti room gradual fill juror take seat prepar ballot over time see window open negoti take place pleasantri exchang if men agre c angri men sidney lumet unsung filmsas present enough evid show crime fact commit verdict guilti but room judg call reason doubt verdict chang each charact film entir differ it almost feel though handpick take part sort experi much feel like watch one unfold each man repres someth unalik with one man decis conform least believ everyth discus courtroom angri men erupt gradual start understand men first let social background one immigr possibl greek french one admit grown condit young defend both men abl relat defend mani way moment afford glimps defend face immigr anonym ghetto strang men vote guilti without hesit angri men sidney lumet unsung filmshenri fonda let u reason disput simpli want decid person life space five minut thi understand viewer take side seem filmmak but juror argu though person though young man slaughter son daughter wive some men notic cobb juror work blind furi a film goe becom evid case never clear juror announc begin for reason likabl charact simpli case accept evid provid without question for other assumpt made result deeproot prejudic massiv complex while mani chang mind influenc ration thought charact simpli get angrier aggress two charact give away racist view power scene run final ten minut work reveal much move brilliant charact portray film the happen describ court unfold second time durat angri men by end though possess knowledg happen courtroom day trial twelv men film helm fonda juror situat play incred detail everi argument theori present u done extrem care passion thi one film stay lifetim simplic allow engrav mind complex demand make sure,Neutral
"An outstanding reenactment of writer Reginald Rose's superlative 1954 ""Studio One"" drama. Director Sidney Lumet shows how the boundaries in cinematic art can be stretched both ways; necessarily minimalist, he moves the actors and cameras in the jury room like a finely tuned ballet. Dependable Henry Fonda gives his best, and it's one of the most convincing ""Best Actor"" performances ever committed to celluloid. The supporting cast is perfect.

No matter how you feel about the film's thought-provoking thesis, you are captivated by juror Fonda's determination. When he introduces a switchblade into evidence - during deliberations! - like the pounding of a gavel, you know Fonda's intentions are premeditated; and, watching him unravel each juror's mind - along with your own - is truly stunning. Anyone interested in becoming a lawyer should consider Fonda a study model.

The defense rests.

"+++++ POSSIBLE SPOILERS +++++

""Twelve Angry Men"" is the perfect demonstration that when you have a good script, an intelligent director an a well selected cast a film doesn't have to be expensive or spectacular to be a real good one. This film is all about dialogues and acting and is set 95% in a small room yet its most entertaining and has a lot of tension.

When I said it had a well selected cast I didn't mean an all star cast; Henry Fonda was the only major star; Lee Cobb, Ed Begley, Martin Balsam and E.G. Marshall where very talented supporting actors but not stars; Jack Warden and Jack Klugman weren't even known much in films yet. But a simple direction by Sidney Lumet leaving the development to the script and actors performances worked well and the film is tense, intriguing and most entertaining from beginning to end.

""Twelve Angry Men"" is a ""trail film"" but with a very original focusing since by following the jury's debate the whole case is clearly revealed up to the verdict. It's also interesting that the verdict is not based in a not guilty conviction by the jurors but for the benefit of the doubt, which means that perhaps the boy actually killed his father.

One of the best movies I've ever seen in its genre.",possibl spoiler twelv angri men perfect demonstr good script intellig director well select cast film doesnt expens spectacular real good one thi film dialogu act set small room yet entertain lot tension when i said well select cast i didnt mean star cast henri fonda major star lee cobb ed begley martin balsam eg marshal talent support actor star jack warden jack klugman werent even known much film yet but simpl direct sidney lumet leav develop script actor perform work well film ten intrigu entertain begin end twelv angri men trail film origin focus sinc follow juri debat whole case clearli reveal verdict it also interest verdict base guilti convict juror benefit doubt mean perhap boy actual kill father one best movi ive ever seen genr,Positive

"Henry Fonda is the star here, but the other roles are filled by legendary character actors. To see Lee Cobb, Jack Klugman, Jack Warden, and Ed Begley all doing there thing at the same time is a joy. My main problem with the movie is that it is soooo preachy. The scene is painted in black and white, there are few shades of gray. Most of the character are stereotypes-- ie, the bigot, the bully, the nerd, the immigrant, the glad-handing but uncaring salesman, etc. It is a tribute to the fine actors that they bring such one-dimensional characters to life. And shining through it all is the oh so good man who has right, justice, and the American way on his side. The self-righteousness is a bit cloying, and I almost expect Fonda to have a halo over his head.

"Saw this first time when I was in 5th grade. Thot it was jus chatting n no action. Saw it again in 9th grade n found it to be totally engaging n character driven movie. Saw again in 2005 n then again few days back on a DVD. 12 Angry Men is a film that has aged incredibly well, offers fantastic performances, fantastic dialogues and a film that can be watched over and appreciated more and more each time. This movie shows in a marvelous simple way the mechanism of the justice system, how easily a man can be convicted to the death sentence based on prejudice, subjective declarations of witnesses and an unprofessional defense lawyer. Everything is good about this film. The screenplay by Reginald Rose (The wild geese, Escape from sobibor) is top notch. The direction by Lumet (Dog day aftnoon, Network, The verdict ) is excellent. It must be appallingly difficult to shoot an entire movie in such a small space, but Lumet does it superbly and the camera work is awesome. All the actors really got into the skin of the character n they portrayed their moods n emotions very well. Henry Fonda (The grapes of wrath, Once upon a time in the west, The longest day) n Lee J. Cobb (The exorcist, On the waterfront, Mackenna's gold) were awesome. So were the rest of the cast.

"A dissenting juror (Henry Fonda) in a murder trial slowly manages to convince the others that the case is not as obviously clear as it seemed in court.

Today's audiences will find a young Jack Warden, perhaps now best known as Big Ben from ""Problem Child"", and Wisconsin-born John Fiedler, whose voice is recognizable as Piglet from ""Winnie the Pooh"". Along with Ed Begley and Henry Fonda, you already have a strong cast (and the other eight men are no slouches).

This film is timeless, both as a tribute to great actors of their generation, but also as a testament of the greatness of the American justice system. One likes to think this has inspired at least a few people to approach jury duty with the utmost seriousness and give the concept of ""reasonable doubt"" a run for its money.",a dissent juror henri fonda murder trial slowli manag convinc other case obvious clear seem court today audienc find young jack warden perhap best known big ben problem child wisconsinborn john fiedler whose voic recogniz piglet winni pooh along ed begley henri fonda alreadi strong cast eight men slouch thi film timeless tribut great actor gener also testament great american justic system one like think inspir least peopl approach juri duti utmost serious give concept reason doubt run money,Positive
"I defy anyone to watch this movie and not be completely absorbed in the group dynamics on display. I could take points off for the overly tidy and convenient script with its TV-movie ending or some of the less subtle methods through which director Sidney Lumet drives home his points. But with a cast as uniformly excellent as this, why quibble? Henry Fonda is just the person to play the liberal everyman, an extension of his Tom Joad character from ""The Grapes of Wrath."" E.G. Marshall is excellent as Fonda's most formidable opponent; cool-headed and logical, he's the only holdout who bases his verdict on facts instead of emotions. Lee J. Cobb's performance wears thin, and his character is the most poorly written. Ed Begley is almost too good in his role, so revolting is his character. Jack Klugman and Jack Warden register in smaller roles as well.

This movie conveys the sweaty, tension-filled atmosphere of a stifling jury room but never feels oppressive, thanks to Lumet's fluid direction. My favorite moment comes when Fonda begins counting off paces around the jury table (a key piece of evidence hinges on this), and the camera drops to floor level and follows his feet as he does so. Choices like this prevent Lumet's film from ever being static or stagy.

An important film and a great one. If you haven't already seen it, put it at the top of your list.

"Overall I loved this movie. It shows the group-dynamics of 12 people, the jury, trying to decide if there is ""reasonable doubt"" concerning whether a young boy killed his father. The discussions are tense and little by little we learn from these what supposedly happened on that night the kids father died. We are therefore also drawn into the question of whether the boy did it or not ourselves and what at first seems like a clear cut case along the way becomes all of a sudden much more complicated. It is a film that dares to handle nuances and ambiguities (we are never certain of whether the boy did it or not) in a way we rarely see. Its also a movie that lets us watch these 12 angry men discuss in the same room for a full 96 minutes without it ever getting boring, which I have to respect; you really have to thrust your material to let a whole movie consist of a discussion.

The movie also tries to show how personal issues can cloud the judgments of the jurors. I am thinking about one specific juror, and although the idea, of showing us how his own personal story interferes with sound judgment, is splendid, I frankly didn't like the way it unfolded in the movie. That's why I only give this movie 8/10.

If this movie in any way is supposed to represent how the legal system work I pray to god that I will never be put in a situation where a jury have to decide my guilt in any matter.

"One does not expect an ordinary black and white movie like ""Twelve Angry Men"" to set the foundation for great drama. Nevertheless, superior drama is what is delivered in this film. The setting is; a common courtroom in an eastern metropolitan city where twelve ordinary men have been selected to sit as a jury. The trial is over and the verbal testimony having been heard, the jury must now decide the fate of the young man on trial for his life. A common enough occurrence in America. But what is not common, is the mixed assortment of characters assembled for the jury. The real drama unfolds when a single juror (Henry Fonda) takes his task seriously and challenges each of his fellow members to think and then decide before they vote for the death penalty. When he does, the volatile reaction is nothing short of inspirational. One can only wish the same would happen to anyone facing a similar ordeal. The cast of characters is a vintage performance from all. Henry Fonda's performance is wonderful and courageous. He is joined by veterans actors, Martin Balsam, John Fiedler, Lee J. Cobb, E.G. Marshall, Jack Klugman, Ed Binns, Jack Warden, Joseph Sweeney, Ed Begley, George Voskovec and Robert Webber.

"I won't repeat the details of the plot as many comments above summarize the plot and even the 12 jurors in depth...

Briefly, Fonda's character challenges the rest of the 12 man jury to take time to reexamine the evidence before they send a very young man to the mandatory death sentence.

A fair challenge. Even tho the case (as one juror argues ) seem so ""open and shut"".

Here, the best thing about the film (to me) is the use of logic. Why? As the 12 men examine each bit of proof, they discover several possible logical flaws or false assumptions. Sound too dry? Not the way it is presented.

My criticism is that Fonda's character is just too perfect, too right and (for most of the movie) too free from perspiration, unlike the rest in that hot jury room.

Fonda early questions some jurors as to whether there's any possibility for error. If he said ""It's possible"" one more time, I was going to scream. (I remember various evil characters getting off on slim technicalities...! ) But fortunately, his questioning leads others to question evidence and to find REAL doubt that the testimony, etc. is valid.

Their use of logic to pick out the evidentiary flaws is fascinating.

"12 Angry Men is a pretentious amateur ""detective"" story who's manipulative intent was easy to spot a mile away. As soon as they showed Henry Fonda's character of the The Architect (Juror # 8) I knew he was going to be the only one emotional enough to vote not guilty and with the help of very poor writing convince everyone else to do the same. Sure enough I was right.

Juror # 8 starts off just believing the 19-year old suspect was abused by his father for ""years"" with absolutely no evidence other than his bleeding heart and not simply disciplined for all the crimes he committed which included mugging, auto theft, robbery and knife fighting because as we know no one ever lies except of course all the eye witnesses in this trial and the detectives.

The Architect just makes one nonsense argument after another and every valid point brought up by the skeptics is just brushed aside until they finally change their mind for no logical reasoning whatsoever.

For instance, juror # 8 just manufacturers a time frame with no evidence to support it about how long it takes elevated train cars to pass by a single point. He does this based on his alleged past experience of living in an apartment near an elevated train line and everyone just buys it with no argument. This is embarrassingly bad for a number of reasons;

Since the film is set in New York City around 1956-57 we can find that during this time period there were 3 distinct elevated train car types (MUDC, Q-CARS and LO-V) from 7 different manufacturers (ACF, Cincinnati, IRT, Jewett, Pullman St. Louis, Wason) operating. It is just assumed in the film that every elevated train in NYC is made up of identical length, height and speed trains with the exact same window dimensions and placement when nothing could be farther from the truth.

What year did Juror # 8 have this apartment and what exact trains were running on the line at that time? Were those the same type's of train cars involved in this case? No answer is given. This is the equivalent of saying that you flew out of an airport years ago therefore all planes are the same and fly at the same speed with no control by the pilot.

Trains are operated by conductors and are variable speed, they speed up and slow down. At any given day a conductor could be running a train faster or slower for any number of reasons. They could be trying to make up time being late and running the train faster, they could have been tired and running the train slower to be safe or any number of other variables. There is no way to know the exact timing of the train that day unless you were there to time it.

Then the old man juror becomes an amateur criminal profiler and accuses the old man witness of lying to be important with no actual evidence to support this just his worthless opinion based on how he looks.

A juror not remembering the details of a movie is not an argument. The day a family member of mine died I have the movie I was watching seared into my head and will never forgot it. During times of increased stress like this you become hyper aware of everything.

The entire debate over how the suspect would have stabbed his dad is waste of time, all that matters was if it was plausible. How a juror would hold the knife is irrelevant.

Apparently the jurors have never heard of reading glasses or sunglasses which first became popular in the 1920's and The Stockbroker (Juror # 4) just decides to become an idiot on this point for no reason.

"Deceptively complex courtroom drama enthrals for the duration as one man opposes eleven others in a battle of argument, reason, and logic.

Starring Henry Fonda as Juror #8, 12 Angry Men is a very claustrophobic drama which conveys the deliberation room of a trial where the defendant is accused of first-degree murder. On the surface the case seems open and shut, with 11 of the 12 jurors entirely convinced by the prosecution's case. Only one dissenter remains, and that is Henry Fonda's Juror #8. Specifically he is not certain that the boy is definitely innocent, just that he doesn't know, and that for him is enough to qualify as reasonable doubt.

12 Angry Men certainly is a moralistic tale, of the right to a fair trial and trying to give someone every chance, but it has many more strings to its bow than just this. Indeed, above all else it prides itself in endeavouring to portray a true sense of reasoned and rational argument which tries to overcome steadfast beliefs as possessed by the seemingly unshakable. Initially it may seem that Fonda's Juror is simply playing devil's advocate, but it becomes clear that it is more about standing up for what you believe despite what the facts seem to tell you. The more you scrutinise so-called unshakable evidence, the more you find holes in it, and the more that logical analysis seems to provide the real answers.

Obviously, Juror #8 has to persuade those others who seem to have their own agenda, and pre-conceived notions of what truth equals, but nevertheless it is absolutely fascinating seeing how simply he probes the case and reveals the flaws.

The whole movie's pace is absolutely perfect, and given its almost exclusive setting of inside the deliberation room it is a testament to the genius of the script and the brilliance of the acting that the duration of the film seems so short. The cinematography is also surprisingly excellent given the lack of scope necessary, with sharp imagery and clever camera-work which gives the whole picture a real amount of life.

To detail the jurors themselves; Juror #1 reluctantly appoints himself foreman. He appears to lack esteem, and the chance to boss the table by being the 'leader' perversely appeals greatly to him as he lacks significant contribution to make about the case. He does not want to be useless, so is forced to take charge.

Juror #2 is a slight man who is clearly used to being wrapped in his own cocoon, never deviating, so when he ends up as a juror in a murder trial, he is actually thrilled at his fish out of water status. He does not really have much to say about the case, taking it at face value.

Juror #3 is the enduring Messenger Service owner. May have an ulterior motive for being so steadfastly sure the accused is guilty, given his first scene depicts ambivalence over the courtroom procedure given to him it is 'open and shut'. As time goes on, and evidence starts to suggest more than meets the eye, he begins to show emotional stress as his hardwired opinion looks flimsier. But he refuses to cave.

Juror #4 has more emotional attachment to the trial than most, as he shares the same kind of background to the defendant and takes criticism of 'that kind of person' extremely personally. Experiences inner conflict between head and heart.

Juror #5 is a cold and methodical thinker who has an elevated opinion of himself. Emerges more as the deliberations wear on, he is convinced by the evidence that the boy is guilty, and systematically sets about conveying this to the others.

Juror #6 is the common working man with very little input, and whose two significant moments are to defend another juror who is being harassed, and to suggest another juror is badly wrong about his opinion.

Juror #7 is more interested in the ball game at 8pm than the case. Doesn't want to be there, and while he details a little about the boy's background to start off with, his regular sarcastic quips throughout the story suggest he is simply desperate to be out of there as quickly as possible, with no care about the wheels of justice.

Juror #8 is the only juror who does not immediately join the others with their guilty verdict. He has a lot of thought about the case eating at him, and wishes to explore it. He meets much opposition.

Juror #9 is a wise, wiley old man who is sharper than anyone else and observed events in the courtroom closer than the others. Makes some smart observations which unearth vital truths.

Juror #10 is an old school racist whose opinion is based on prejudice and not facts. A vile and odious creature, he has no interest in 'people like that' roaming the streets, and is offended at having to live in the same city as them.

Juror #11 is an intelligent and interested spectator who listens to the facts and analyses them before reaching a conclusion. His European accent draws derision from some others, as does his general nationality, but he rises above it and provides some sensible comments, rarely saying anything which lacks thought.

Juror #12 is a good-natured man but not a terribly strong thinker. He does not have much of an independent opinion on the case, often following others, and is often more interested in playing naughts and crosses or boring fellow jurors about his job.

Overall, 12 Angry Men is simply as good as cinema can get. Incredible script, amazing performances, and captivating direction.

"Twelve-man jury decides the fate of a young man on trial for murder; eleven think the kid is guilty, the twelfth isn't so sure. Director Sidney Lumet makes his directorial debut here, and he's overly fond of riled-up actors shouting at the camera, but he doesn't stray from the proved path of this celebrated play by Reginald Rose, and that's a plus (the material stands quite well on its own). The claustrophobic, muggy atmosphere is rife with tension, and Henry Fonda is a tower of sanity as the only voice of reason. The film attempts to substitute the electricity of a live performance with too many tight shots of angry, sweaty faces, spitting and yelling, however this ensemble cast has a rich anti-camaraderie that puts the film across. *** from ****",twelveman juri decid fate young man trial murder eleven think kid guilti twelfth isnt sure director sidney lumet make directori debut he overli fond riledup actor shout camera doesnt stray prove path celebr play reginald rose that plu materi stand quit well the claustrophob muggi atmospher rife tension henri fonda tower saniti voic reason the film attempt substitut electr live perform mani tight shot angri sweati face spit yell howev ensembl cast rich anticamaraderi put film across,Neutral

"For its time, this movie must've been excellent. However, today it holds up as a good older movie that was filmed in black and white with many other older films in its time, shortly before, and shortly after surpassing it. Films such as Casablanca, Vertigo, North by Northwest, Gone With the Wind, Some Like It Hot, Sunset Boulevard, and many others are equally as good for this time period, and some are much better.

While I did appreciate and respect the movie and even liked it, I was very surprised at how high it was ranked on here at number five. There were no major plot twists, surprises, or even tour de force performances that you would also see in some other black and white older films. The concept was very interesting and kept my attention, but even some of the arguments and deductions that the jurors made were not truly logical. Some of them were intelligent, like when Henry Fonda measured the amount of time it would take for the older man witness to walk to the door, as well as when he proved he could purchase the weapon, but overall some of the points made were guesswork.

The truth is that at the end of the day, the director decides to paint Fonda's character as an ideal perfect person while clealry letting the culprit, likely guilty, walk free, which I felt betrayed the script's ambiguity. And to be totally honest, it would have been a much better movie, warranting a ranking of five all-time, if there was a plot twist that one of the juror's arguing for guilt was indeed the actual culrpit- a twist I was waiting and hoping for that I never got. Instead, we get a glorification of Fonda's character to the very end, ironically an antihero that wasn't truly meant to be that allowed the guilty one walk free.

"Title: ""12 Angry Men: A Timeless Masterpiece""In an age where the allure of modern blockbusters often overshadows the cinematic treasures of the past, Sidney Lumet's ""12 Angry Men"" stands as a testament to the enduring power of classic cinema. Released in 1957, this timeless masterpiece continues to captivate audiences with its gripping narrative and timeless themes. At first glance, the premise may seem simple: twelve jurors are tasked with deciding the fate of a young man accused of murder. But as the deliberations unfold within the confines of a claustrophobic jury room, the film delves deep into the complexities of human nature, exploring themes of prejudice, justice, and the power of empathy. What sets ""12 Angry Men"" apart is its masterful storytelling and impeccable craftsmanship. Shot almost entirely within the confines of a single room, the film relies on dialogue and character development to drive the narrative forward. Each juror brings their own biases and preconceptions to the table, leading to heated debates and intense confrontations that lay bare the flaws and foibles of the human condition. As the tension mounts and the stakes grow higher, the true brilliance of ""12 Angry Men"" shines through. Through the lens of the jury room, the film holds a mirror up to society, forcing viewers to confront their own prejudices and assumptions. In doing so, it transcends the confines of its era, offering timeless insights into the nature of justice and the power of collective action. But perhaps the greatest strength of ""12 Angry Men"" lies in its ability to resonate with audiences across generations. Despite being over six decades old, the film remains as relevant today as it was upon its release. Its exploration of themes such as systemic bias and the importance of due process continues to strike a chord in an age marked by social and political turmoil. Moreover, the performances of the cast elevate ""12 Angry Men"" to a level of cinematic excellence rarely seen. Led by Henry Fonda as Juror 8, the ensemble cast delivers performances that are as nuanced as they are compelling. Each actor brings depth and authenticity to their role, breathing life into characters that transcend the confines of the screen. As the credits roll and the final verdict is reached, ""12 Angry Men"" leaves an indelible impression on the viewer. It is a film that challenges conventions and defies expectations, reminding us of the power of cinema to provoke thought and inspire change. In a world inundated with flashy special effects and CGI-laden spectacles, ""12 Angry Men"" serves as a reminder of the timeless appeal of storytelling in its purest form. It is a film that reminds us of the importance of empathy, understanding, and the pursuit of justice - values that are as relevant today as they were in 1957. In conclusion, ""12 Angry Men"" is not just a movie; it is a timeless masterpiece that continues to captivate and inspire audiences with its powerful message and masterful execution.

"12 Angry Men is a very different thriller, it isn't even classified as one here on IMDb. But it is still a thriller nontheless, since it thrills, and boy does it thrill well !

It has no hidden bombs ready to detonate, no climactic shootout, no heroes getting imprisoned in the lair of the villains, but the suspense comes from one simple thing: the dialouge.

12 Angry Men is built on one of the better screenplays I have seen, and that is quite a feat since 90% of the movie takes place in one single room. But that is perhaps what makes it so tense and so great; the fact that you are stuck in one room with twelve very differing jurors divided into two groups, each of them trying to debunk the arguments of the opposing side over one question; is a teen convicted of first-degree murder guilty, or not guilty ? The heated conversations between the twelve delivers constant curveballs and plot twists, some quite shocking.

What I also love about the movie is the fact that it all seems like one take (comparisons can be made with the recent 1917 (2019), but perhaps not to the same extent). The excellent editing and the brilliant acting by all twelve jurors make sure of this.

I have seen people complaining over the lack of music in 12 Angry Men, but in my opinion, the dialouge serves as the music, if that makes any sense. It is a pure delight to listen to.

To conclude, 12 Angry Men is one of the best and most suspenseful movies I have ever seen, but in a very different way. It is a great shame that it is not as widely avaliable as some other highly rated IMDb titles, but perhaps that only adds to its factor of exclusivity.

"The best thing about this movie was watching the classic Hollywood and TV actors. The writing was good and is seldom found in movies today. Apart from that the film was nothing special.

After 20 minutes I could already see the end of the movie. Also I thought it a stretch that Henry Fonda's character could be so persuasive simply by standing his ground and saying 'maybe he's guilty and maybe he isn't.'

Perhaps its high IMDb rating is because a lot of people agree with the moral message it preaches. Maybe the moral message is 10 star but the movie is not. If you want to see a really good, classic, one scene, character study movie, check out Hitchcock's ""Lifeboat"".",the best thing movi watch classic hollywood tv actor the write good seldom found movi today apart film noth special after minut i could alreadi see end movi also i thought stretch henri fonda charact could persuas simpli stand ground say mayb he guilti mayb isnt perhap high imdb rate lot peopl agre moral messag preach mayb moral messag star movi if want see realli good classic one scene charact studi movi check hitchcock lifeboat,Positive

-First Time Watch-

I watched this movie over the course of three days in my American Government class. By the end of the movie, more then half my class loved it. I didn't like it as much. Earlier this year we had watched 'Mr. Smith Goes to Washington' starring James Stewart. I found that one much more enjoyable since the characters did more then just sit around a table and discussing if a young boy really did kill his father or not. The story was slow, with a few surprises here and there but nothing spectacular. Our government teacher told us it was one of the best movies ever, according to the movie critics of that time, but I would have to disagree with the critics. It was just okay. Was it good to show to better understand the legal system? Yes. But, just for a movie to watch after a long week? Better keep looking.

"In a Hollywood oversaturated with Star Wars, Jurassic Park, and superhero movies, the idea of a talented small group making a movie on a budget, sounds mortifying. 12 Angry Men proves not only that it can be done, but it can make one of the best films ever.

The movie begins with a judge telling 12 jurors to decide the fate of an accused boy. Then the 12 jurors go to a room to discuss the trial. And after they decide the boys fate the movie ends. Get a cast and crew of 20 talented people, and you can make it yourself.

The jurors discuss at length the events of the trial, as well as the crime which lead to it, all without any flashback scenes. When I first heard of it, I was worried it was going to be boring, but with strong performances from all jurors, great camera work, and a compelling case, I found myself under the trance of this masterpiece.

It's not always a comfortable movie. The jurors are constantly yelling, the camera is claustrophobic, and the characters get sweaty, and it captures the jurors just perfectly. The case was interesting enough to begin with, but as new evidence presents itself, the film constantly gets more fascinating as it progresses.

12 Angry Men is a film with a story to tell and it doesn't need a huge budget to tell it. I highly recommend, especially to the filmmakers of the future.",in hollywood oversatur star war jurass park superhero movi idea talent small group make movi budget sound mortifi angri men prove done make one best film ever the movi begin judg tell juror decid fate accus boy then juror go room discus trial and decid boy fate movi end get cast crew talent peopl make the juror discus length event trial well crime lead without flashback scene when i first heard i worri go bore strong perform juror great camera work compel case i found tranc masterpiec it alway comfort movi the juror constantli yell camera claustrophob charact get sweati captur juror perfectli the case interest enough begin new evid present film constantli get fascin progress angri men film stori tell doesnt need huge budget tell i highli recommend especi filmmak futur,Positive
"This movie makes you wonder whether the jury system is the best way of deciding the outcome of a court case. Twelve ""ordinary"" men and women decide the fate of the defendant - how many are objective about the process? Some bring personal prejudices into the jury room - others couldn't care less about the outcome. These points are effectively raised in the movie.

Even though the action is confined to one room, the dialogue kept me riveted to the screen till the end. All the actors portrayed the different personalities of the jurors very well.",thi movi make wonder whether juri system best way decid outcom court case twelv ordinari men woman decid fate defend mani object process some bring person prejudic juri room other couldnt care less outcom these point effect rais movi even though action confin one room dialogu kept rivet screen till end all actor portray differ person juror well,Positive
"The concept of 'Reasonable Doubt' is highly pervasive within the Judicial System; it is the concept that eventually decides the fates of the accused, and is the concept that is one of the most controversial. It's controversy lies in the fact that it is purely subjective, and dependent on the individuals that comprise the jury. The notion of Reasonable Doubt has no one definition, yet it is almost universally known. In 12 ANGRY MEN, Sidney Lumet successfully gives the viewer an idea of how this concept comes into play in a trial.

It is worth noting that while this may be one of the best courtroom movies of all time, it doesn't in fact occur in the actual courtroom; all but 3 or 4 minutes of this Motion Picture is spent in the confines of a Jury Room, where the verdict is hotly debated. Lumet does well to present the Room as a sort of confinement from which there is no escape until a unanimous verdict is decided. As the film progresses, the sense of urgency and claustrophobia sets in, and the tension becomes increasingly high. The first technique Lumet used was to employ the locked door. The second was to cue the rain, which gives the feeling that even the outdoors are 'inaccessible' and that only the Room exists. The third technique may be missed by less astute viewers; Lumet switches his scope from wide to narrow to close-up during the movie, which adds to the claustrophobic feeling mentioned earlier.

The acting is top-notch, as required by any good character study. All 12 men have been developed to some appreciable extent, but the key players have been developed to a comprehensive level given the film's ~95 minute run-time. Henry Fonda is brilliant as the 'hesitant' juror, but to me Lee J. Cobb outshines him in almost every scene (save the opening scenes).

Another aspect of the film worth mentioning is the Music (or lack thereof). This is another intentional ploy by Lumet to give the viewer a 'feel' of the Room. There is no Music in the Jury Room, so why should there be in this film? I agree that while a musical background score serves to enhance or capture the mood of the scene, sometimes the absence of the music (silence) speaks volumes, by allowing the viewer to concentrate fully on the scene(s). One of my favourite movies lacking in music is NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN. Another brilliant score-less Motion Picture is CAST AWAY, where no music is used for the entire length of time that Tom Hanks is stranded.

The screenplay is solid and intelligently sound. In fact the only thing that stopped this film from winning Best Picture, Best Director, and Best Screenplay was the excellent THE BRIDGE ON THE RIVER KWAI. Had the movie been made a year or two earlier, it may well have won the esteemed accolades.

I can see why this film ranks in IMDb's All-time Top 10. It is simply a brilliant Motion Picture that has wide appeal, and can be enjoyed and appreciated by many.

4 stars (out of 4). 8/10. Will appear in my Top 200 at around 167 or so.

"12 angry men is a masterpiece of cinematic work. It was in those days and for me it still is.

"I have tried, and tried again to like this film. But I fail after the first fifteen minutes. For a start it is a Henry Fonda vehicle based on a television play. And sadly it still looks like and feels like a television play. The line up of actors like Ed Begley, Lee J. Cobb etc is impressive and they act well if over theatrically. Fonda is Fonda and I repeat he is the star and he does his best to shrug off his usual coldness on film. I have nothing against his acting except that I do not respond to his way of performing. A little more warmth, and being less dour I would perhaps, and it is a big perhaps, to respond to him better. So this for me is one of the fault lines in the film and his stabbing a knife on the table is a great moment. Being a big star the moment has tremendous impact, and no doubt most audiences are caught. As for the plot of the film it is about a youth who has to all intents committed a murder and twelve jurors debate about his going to the electric chair or not. I know it was 1957 and just maybe it was too daring to ask but no one questions capital punishment in itself, and twelve angry men could dispute that in itself but of course it is not on the table. The film is often praised for its camera movements, claustrophobic towards the end and less so at the beginning. The only unintended humour for me was one of the more elderly men taking too long in the toilet. Or bathroom in ' respectable ' terms and the latter is of course used. No spoilers to the ending. But with signposts all the way a child could work it out. I also have not read in any reviews of this ' great ' film that the jurors are all baying for blood, and to get out of the room on a hot day as soon as possible. My opinion is I know a minority one, but for me the film does not dare to even question the biggest of all basic and human issues and that is if capital punishment is right or wrong in itself.",i tri tri like film but i fail first fifteen minut for start henri fonda vehicl base televis play and sadli still look like feel like televis play the line actor like ed begley lee j cobb etc impress act well theatric fonda fonda i repeat star best shrug usual cold film i noth act except i respond way perform a littl warmth less dour i would perhap big perhap respond better so one fault line film stab knife tabl great moment be big star moment tremend impact doubt audienc caught a plot film youth intent commit murder twelv juror debat go electr chair i know mayb dare ask one question capit punish twelv angri men could disput cours tabl the film often prais camera movement claustrophob toward end less begin the unintend humour one elderli men take long toilet or bathroom respect term latter cours use no spoiler end but signpost way child could work i also read review great film juror bay blood get room hot day soon possibl my opinion i know minor one film dare even question biggest basic human issu capit punish right wrong,Positive

"I am writing this review before reading any of the others, so as not to be influenced by them.

When I saw this film almost two decades ago I was absolutely riveted by the powerful, intense, unrelenting drama and suspense and the profound ethical content, not to mention the artistically uncompromising, sparse esthetics. The last scene, when Fonda walks out into the fresh air and gives a fond glance to the immense pillars of justice caused me to shed some tears, because I wasn't sure if I shared his abiding faith in the ultimate triumph of JUSTICE. In memory, the power of this film has faded, because it seems too comically optimistic. Justice ALWAYS triumphs in the end. It's a well-meaning, compassionate message, but it is also irresponsible. (Or is the message perhaps, that compassionate people should participate in juries more often?) True ethics and jurisprudence cannot afford such facile confidence. There is an insidious equation of law with justice. Every true legal mind, knows that the letter of the law can overwhelm the spirit of the law. Justice is just too big a topic for a movie!

"The only bad thing about this movie is that it ends, leaving the viewer with a bitter question : ""why aren't there movies like this anymore?"" No need for extravagant sets, no need for more than one room for the entire history of human race to unfold before our eyes. Looking inside of us, personally and as a species, we can all identify each and every one of the jurors. We all have acted indifferently, got carried away with anger, or with prejudice. We all are (or should be) capable of standing out for just causes like Henry Fonda's character. It's a question of choice, ethic and circumstance.

"Generally I consider one time enough to watch a movie, but this movie has so much depth in the dialogue that I felt I could watch it again right after it finished.

It is a deep dive in human psychology and how facts are perceived depending on the social surrounding. How each person sees the world from their own unique viewpoint. We will all recognize ourselves in one character or another and we see people we know portrayed on screen.

Now I did read a review about the high morality and feel-good vibe., but that is not really the essence of it. We will have to admit that, even though we want, we are unlikely that one person willing to stand up against everyone else. Probably most of us are like the majority of the group. Only willing to speak when we feel we have been granted safety by someone else willing to stand up against the loud people that overwhelm us. That makes the story feel real and engaging. It shows how quick people get drawn into the argumentation of those who simply are loud and confident. Most people are willing to listen provided they are granted the chance to be heard themselves. You have to dive deep and give them a chance to draw their own conclusions, within their own viewpoint. Forcing your argument only lasts as long as the receiver allows it.

"This film is a must see! No bells and whistles here, just the clear suspenseful plot of 12 men negotiating the future of a young man charged with murdering his father. Simply made, this black and white classic is nearly exclusively filmed in the confines of a small, hot, and miserable jurors room.

Juror #8, played by Henry Fonda, sets the standard initially with the sole ""Not Guilty"" vote. Each character then has to do some serious soul-searching to remove personal bias, conformity, and arrogance to properly perform their civic duty of determining the accused youth's fate. Sidney Lumet masterfully composes an instant classic by giving the viewers an inner look at individual and group conflict along with conflict resolution. This film is a great case study for communication styles for individuals and groups, as well.

Award winning acting, simplistic yet revealing dialogue, and before it's time camera angles and editing join together beautifully to create a suspense driven plot without the use of action, color, special effects, or an expensive budget.",thi film must see no bell whistl clear suspens plot men negoti futur young man charg murder father simpli made black white classic nearli exclus film confin small hot miser juror room juror play henri fonda set standard initi sole not guilti vote each charact seriou soulsearch remov person bia conform arrog properli perform civic duti determin accus youth fate sidney lumet master compos instant classic give viewer inner look individu group conflict along conflict resolut thi film great case studi commun style individu group well award win act simplist yet reveal dialogu time camera angl edit join togeth beauti creat suspens driven plot without use action color special effect expens budget,Positive
"However, collective intelligence and laborious pursuit of the truth itself sometimes take people near the truth. Twelve jurors are simplified integration of almost all types of people you can see in real life. Emotional one, smart one, reasonable one, wise one, rambling one, indecisive one, coward one, quiet one, loud one, and etc. I have never seen a movie with such a limited story and the setting. The whole move takes place in one setting: jurors' room and has one simple narrative: deciding defendant's guilt or innocence. However, it contains the whole society: how one's conviction can work in right or wrong way, what it takes to change others' opinions, what percentage of proportion is perfect between conviction and possibility, and how an individual deems 'the life'.

One thing I have particularly noticed is the temperature in the room and the weather outside. Because the room is stuffed, and all jurors are sweating, stress, pressure and unpleasantness in decision making process is thoroughly conveyed to the audience. The level of griminess peaks when the vote reaches six to six. Then, it rains, and a fan starts to work, forecasting pleasant momentum toward resolution or settlement. I also want to praise the camera work. It intensifies the sense of confined space without disturbing actors' delivery of emotion. When it is the vital moment of discovery of evidence, the camera closes up the actor with the line. However, other times, scenes are shot across the room vertically, emphasizing the narrowness with many people overlapping some parts of their body.

I will not deny '12 Angry Men' is philosophical art. However, it does not do enough to overcome the weakness this movie is born with, no dynamics and too linear because of finite story and setting. It misses out on most of what 'motion pictures' can offer.",howev collect intellig labori pursuit truth sometim take peopl near truth twelv juror simplifi integr almost type peopl see real life emot one smart one reason one wise one rambl one indecis one coward one quiet one loud one etc i never seen movi limit stori set the whole move take place one set juror room one simpl narr decid defend guilt innoc howev contain whole societi one convict work right wrong way take chang other opinion percentag proport perfect convict possibl individu deem life one thing i particularli notic temperatur room weather outsid becaus room stuf juror sweat stress pressur unpleas decis make process thoroughli convey audienc the level grimi peak vote reach six six then rain fan start work forecast pleasant momentum toward resolut settlement i also want prais camera work it intensifi sen confin space without disturb actor deliveri emot when vital moment discoveri evid camera close actor line howev time scene shot across room vertic emphas narrow mani peopl overlap part bodi i deni angri men philosoph art howev enough overcom weak movi born dynam linear finit stori set it miss motion pictur offer,Positive

But as the story unfolds you get to see more and more of the Jury's personality, through the way they behave and what they say. The writers of this movie did an amazing job creating twelve so distinctly different characters, and that's what makes this movie interesting.

"I love my kino, and love my classics, so let's get down to brass tacks as to why I give this a 6.

* The movie is timeless. It could have been shot in any decade.

* The movie was well ahead of its time in terms of photography

... and that's about it.

But, just like the jurors in ""12AM"", we must look beyond the 'facts'.

* First, the acting. It's superb at times, and really quaint not-in-a-good way in others. So while the photography has not aged one bit, the acting and the characterization has.

* Second, the plot line. There's so much good stuff in there, it's so well paced, that it's too easy to overlook the bad: the ending is as flat as they come (bombastic trumpets of the victor leaving the court in his white suit, really?), and the ""Kaiser Sauze"" moment that's hinted at from the beginning never comes. Ergo, it's didactic, and ergo, it's not that ""mind blowing"" at all.

* Third, it's a movie that's getting a lot of good ratings because of the current political climate. It's easy to call this timeless while taking down a disney attraction because it's linked to ""Song of the South"". It's also convenient to honour a movie that references the constitution amendment while ignoring that 2A is a thing. Funny how college in the US pick their 'Timeless classics"".

If someone asked you to create a compelling film, shot in only one location, black and white, a dozen actors, no fancy camera work, almost non-stop dialogue, and based entirely on an argument, could you do it?

Well, 12 Angry Men rises to that exact occasion. If you're one that appreciates some mystery, drama, a rollercoaster of a ride, you'll enjoy this movie. Granted it's not for all, its lack of action, romance or Michael Bay explosions may have some falling asleep, but to those who appreciate a good thriller, it'll have you on the edge of your seat the whole time.

It's easy to become desensitized today about what truly makes a good movie, with CGI a norm, relying solely on A list actors and actresses instead of a good screenplay prolific, we forget just how powerful well-written dialogue is. It's that dialogue that transports you into this movie, that thrusts you into the whirlwind of plot and emotion and doesn't let go until the movie's over. You walk away from this film in awe, not thinking well if 100 million dollars falls in my lap I could make a movie like that. No, you start thinking, damn, I have no excuse, this movie proves that it's story that matters, not extravagant displays of big budgets.

"What is there to be said that hasn't already been said? It's earned it's status as a classic for a reason. While I wouldn't go so far as to call it one of the greatest of all time, it is a vastly entertaining take on a brilliant premise that has been used throughout the decades sense. The dialogue is sharp, the character turns are believable and interesting and the whole thing flows along at a swift pace. When it was over I couldn't believe that so much time had gone by. I'm always fascinated by films that take place entirely in one location (or almost entirely) and this was one of the early precedents for the kind of greatness one can accomplish when that is utilized properly.

The ominous surroundings like the heat and the storm add nice bits of tension to the rising tempers of the men in the room and the confrontations between the soft Henry Fonda and the explosive Lee J. Cobb were intense. Sidney Lumet is a man who earned his reputation as an ""actor's director"" and made his career out of mostly setting up the stage and aiding his actors in doing what they do best, but I think his stylistic choices here deserve to be commended. The way that he slowly brings the camera down over the course of the film, bringing us more intimately into the heart of this room, it adds that sense of claustrophobia that makes the tension even more gripping as we proceed into the later stages of it all.

Practically everyone in the cast shines at one point or another, my favorites being the commanding Fonda who is able to be the voice of reason without being annoying, the pensive E.G. Marshall, the racist and volatile Ed Begley and the wise, determined Joseph Sweeney. The film had plenty of great twists, like the knife reveal, but my favorite scene had to be Begley going off on his offensive monologue while one-by-one the jurors turned away from him until he realized that his ignorance had caused him to lose any voice he once had; a powerfully real moment. I also loved the added touch of putting Fonda in an all white suit while everyone else was in shades of black or grey.",what said hasnt alreadi said it earn statu classic reason while i wouldnt go far call one greatest time vastli entertain take brilliant premis use throughout decad sen the dialogu sharp charact turn believ interest whole thing flow along swift pace when i couldnt believ much time gone im alway fascin film take place entir one locat almost entir one earli preced kind great one accomplish util properli the omin surround like heat storm add nice bit tension rise temper men room confront soft henri fonda explos lee j cobb intens sidney lumet man earn reput actor director made career mostli set stage aid actor best i think stylist choic deserv commend the way slowli bring camera cours film bring u intim heart room add sen claustrophobia make tension even grip proceed later stage practic everyon cast shine one point anoth favorit command fonda abl voic reason without annoy pensiv eg marshal racist volatil ed begley wise determin joseph sweeney the film plenti great twist like knife reveal favorit scene begley go offens monologu onebyon juror turn away realiz ignor caus lose voic power real moment i also love ad touch put fonda white suit everyon el shade black grey,Positive
"Here's a film made only in a room that looks hot and humid and only on a budget of $349,000. The twelve jurors must decide unanimously on a case of first degree murder whether the accused is guilty or not guilty. When they walk into a jury room which is both hot and humid they become acquainted with the personalities of their peers at first.Then they do a vote with the motive of finishing that taken-for granted murder case.However right at that moment they realize that one of the jurors doesn't like the quick open and shut situation of the case and he says ""it needed to be talked"" based on his reasonable doubt! Because it's not an unanimous voting the case need to be talked then a whole set of serious arguments ensues.Sifting of the evidence disclose the errors of the prosecution's case, the doubtful representation by the defendant's court-appointed attorney, and the true inner-deep character of each of the jury members.Well that's what I love just a room twelve people..one man a lone dissenter force the others to think why they vote yes why they don't no.He forces them to share a responsibility and he is even tactful enough to mention that the accused kid has been subjected to violence..that he needs more than just a fair-looking trial before sending him to the chair.Henry Fonda as the cool,calm and wise questioning one dissenter is just awesome the other 11 days are good too but Joseph Sweeney as the wise and observant elderly man named McCardle caught my attention too!

"I'm one who likes to look at IMDb and watch some movies based on ratings from this site. This one is probably the most overrated movie I have ever seen.

"A complete classic that stands the test of time. Extremely well written with giving us a group of 12 men who are in a court case and are the ones who will decide the fate of a young man who was put on trial for a murder it seems very obvious he committed, but over the course of the movie more information is uncovered showing whether he truly did it or not. Great dialogue that gives you an insight into these characters without showing you any of their backstory, fun back and forth talk between characters.

"This marvelous story from the late 50s, is about a juror(Henry Fonda) who along with 11 other jurors, try to come up with a reasonable verdict for a murder trial. He believes that the accused in this case is innocent and in the beginning, he is the only person who has this particular opinion. Later on in this powerful tale, he manages to persuade the other jurors that the accused might be innocent with his skills of analyzing legal matters.

What surprised me the most was this: Usually, courtroom dramas often begin with a shot of the crime scene that took place whereas this movie starts directly with the jurors' discussion. It doesn't even have a trial but still has a capability to mesmerize people's minds with just ONE shot in ONE room. The heated discussion between the jurors along with the twists and turns in the statements of the witness, makes this movie greatly enthralling. I watched this movie with my family and all of us got so indulged in the movie that we found every scene fascinating. Besides, all the actors did a fabulous job being in a different character's shoe. Each juror had different thoughts and approaches towards the matter and the actors wonderfully embodied it.

Thus, I think that this flawless movie is a must-watch for every person who adores trials and courtroom dramas.",thi marvel stori late jurorhenri fonda along juror tri come reason verdict murder trial he believ accus case innoc begin person particular opinion later power tale manag persuad juror accus might innoc skill analyz legal matter what surpris usual courtroom drama often begin shot crime scene took place wherea movi start directli juror discus it doesnt even trial still capabl mesmer peopl mind one shot one room the heat discus juror along twist turn statement wit make movi greatli enthral i watch movi famili u got indulg movi found everi scene fascin besid actor fabul job differ charact shoe each juror differ thought approach toward matter actor wonder embodi thu i think flawless movi mustwatch everi person ador trial courtroom drama,Neutral
"12 Angry Man is a brilliant movie about the value of a human life. Essentially, it is a discussion between 12 jurors who must decide on the life of a young man. The film takes place in real time and deals with important issues such as human morality and the fact that our decisions are shaped by our own experiences, prejudices and even selfishness. Each of the 12 men is different, has a unique profession that reflects his personality, and has had his own experiences in life. As a viewer, it's just exciting to see each perspective and how each one tries to argue.

"A great film. I've only even seen parts at different times. I always meant to sit down and watch the whole thing, but too much to do lately, I work. Luckily, AMC is showing it often, so maybe I'll see the whole thing.

But for now - here are my thoughts: Henry Fonda is superb - did the kid really do it? I still don't know. But the character actor suppport is audacious! Everyone is in there - Jack Klugman, Ed Begley, Sr., Martin Balsam, Jack Warden, E.G. Marhshall, what more can we want in black and white? That's when the camera operators show their greatness.

I think 1939 was the greatest film year of all - Grapes of Wrath, Wizard of Oz, and the very special Gone With the Wind.

I watch old black and whites whenever I can - Bette Davis, Claudette Colbert, Veronica Lake (So Proudly We Hail), Lauren Bacall, Clark Gable (my favorite), Humphrey Bogart (Deadline USA'52 is a favorite besides Casablanca), James Stewart (FBI Story one of his best here), they are all the greats. Not one to touch them these days.

Curiously, though - I like the new Drew Barrymore. She's become a woman.

"It seems that this movie is unanimously a masterpiece, a 9/10, and according to the list, the #5 best movie of all time according to IMDB.

I'm going to be the dissenting juror to this conviction. While the movie is undoubtedly very good for its time and for being a black and white movie, I believe it is overrated at its score and where it sits in the top 5. I'm astonished this is as high ranked and rated actually.

It's like the jurors in the room pressuring everybody to side with their opinion, and anybody who doesn't agree with their assertion is outcasted and must give into peer pressure and consent to a 9/10. However, not me, I give this very good movie a 7/10, and I could see it in the 90-100 ranked range, maybe the 50 range at best.

There is practically no action, no big twists, and no grand surprises. There were just a couple of scenes such as where Fonda's character pulls out the knife or when the angry juror demonstrates the angle of the knife on Fonda that created some tension, but most of it is too even and simplistic to be considered great. Sure, the arguments brought up by the characters were often interesting and valid, but they were just using step by step logic that wasn't overly cerebral. That's fine, but the point is that there was no big mindblowing 'aha' moment. It was just a step by step chiseling of the evidence that was again interesting at some times, but at others it was just basic.

There was definitely a lot to learn from in this movie in terms of how a jury works if one has never been on one, as well as how the system works regarding arriving at verdicts. I'm sure for its time, it was very enlightening for people unfamiliar with the constitution, and even today there are timeless elements to the study of the situation.

I have one more minor criticism. While Fonda's acting was good, I found his character to be a little bit too much portrayed like an angel. The director even has him place the most angry juror's jacket on him at the end, and the camera just about solely focuses in on him at the end. They didn't even include the reading of the final verdict or show the boy's or the attorneys' reactions or the courtroom's. I mean, come on, Fonda's character may have just convinced eleven other men to let the culprit walk free, and yet the director paints him as a basically perfect person, like an angel. I think this betrays the script in a sense because there was ample evidence that the boy was guilty, not because of the pathetic prejudicial arguments or preconceptions of character, but because of some other key pieces of evidence. For example, just because juror four can't remember the exact name of the movie he saw or struggles to recall the actor names shouldn't be enough to disregard the boy's statements. I'm not saying he was definitely guilty, but the way the script was playing out, I don't think it was clear enough to pain Fonda's character as this perfect person the way they did, especially at the end, although this could be a trope of the times in the 1950's to always have a hero be idealized.

In summation, it is a very good movie, but I probably wouldn't watch it again as it is rather monotonous with very little action if any at all and very few twists. Still, I'm glad I watched it once and would put it in the top 30 or so of black and white movies, but definitely not in the top 5 movies of all time. Just off the top of my head, Casablanca, It's a Wonderful Life, The Birds, Rear Window, Vertigo, and Gone With the Wind are better older movies than this was.",it seem movi unanim masterpiec accord list best movi time accord imdb im go dissent juror convict while movi undoubtedli good time black white movi i believ overr score sit top im astonish high rank rate actual it like juror room pressur everybodi side opinion anybodi doesnt agre assert outcast must give peer pressur consent howev i give good movi i could see rank rang mayb rang best there practic action big twist grand surpris there coupl scene fonda charact pull knife angri juror demonstr angl knife fonda creat tension even simplist consid great sure argument brought charact often interest valid use step step logic wasnt overli cerebr that fine point big mindblow aha moment it step step chisel evid interest time other basic there definit lot learn movi term juri work one never one well system work regard arriv verdict im sure time enlighten peopl unfamiliar constitut even today timeless element studi situat i one minor critic while fonda act good i found charact littl bit much portray like angel the director even place angri juror jacket end camera sole focus end they didnt even includ read final verdict show boy attorney reaction courtroom i mean come fonda charact may convinc eleven men let culprit walk free yet director paint basic perfect person like angel i think betray script sen ampl evid boy guilti pathet prejudici argument preconcept charact key piec evid for exampl juror four cant rememb exact name movi saw struggl recal actor name shouldnt enough disregard boy statement im say definit guilti way script play i dont think clear enough pain fonda charact perfect person way especi end although could trope time alway hero ideal in summat good movi i probabl wouldnt watch rather monoton littl action twist still im glad i watch would put top black white movi definit top movi time just top head casablanca it wonder life the bird rear window vertigo gone with wind better older movi,Positive
"It just goes to show, you can have the largest budget, the greatest special effects and the most explosive action, but all a film really needs is a great script and a great cast, and '12 Angry Men' is a testament to that.

Despite virtually the entirety of this film being set in one room, this has to be one of the most compelling dramas I've seen. For a film with such a simple format, it had me hooked from start to finish.

To be honest, I think some of the dialog and a couple of the plot points are weak, but Lumet's direction keeps the movie moving seamlessly forward. All the actors are good, with Ed Begley, EG Marshall and Henry Fonda particularly so. It is Lee J. Cobb, however, that stands out for me. So powerful yet nuanced. Near the end, after Cobb recounts ""every single"" reason he thinks the kid is guilty, John Fiedler says ""You said we could throw out all the other evidence"" Cobb's reaction of bewilderment and frustration rang so true I have a hard time believing he was acting.

A fun exercise is to figure out the juror you most identify with. For me it is Fonda. Thoughtful, respectful, balanced, and cautious.

"It's a movie that takes place in one hot, smoke-filled, sweaty room, at a time when men felt naked if they took their jacket and tie off. 11 come into the room wanting to fry the defendant; one man starts pointing out all the ambiguous testimony. He nobly upholds the concept of ""reasonable doubt."" Guess who triumphs?

The movie is remarkable. Sidney Lumet was even then a master filmmaker. The claustrophobia is palpable, but the camera is fluid enough to give you every angle on the closed, locked room, and every emotion and bead of sweat on the men trapped there.

The story, however, presents easy heroes and villains: the everyman just trying to make sure justice is done; the bigot who can't keep his opinions to himself; the noble immigrant. Cliches all, even back in 1957.

Yet, the cast is so real. These are real, sweaty, down-to-earth actors putting on the performances of their lives. You always feel like you are in there with them, following the logic, thinking about whether the evidence presented is believable.

"12 men debating over the fate of a boy who was suspected of killing his father. 12 different personalities and an array of interests, the debates portrayed the importance of listening, understanding, respect and empathy.

It is vital we disentangle perceptions and emotions from the problem. As perceptions are shaped by varied experiences and values, an array of perceptions is undeniable in any negotiation. However, allowing perceptions to determine our views on the problem at hand is detrimental as it not only leads to an obscuration of truth, but also an inaccurate basis upon which we make a decision. For example, Juror 10, with his preconceived prejudices against slum-dwellers as a result of his experience living among them, voted ""Guilty"". This prejudice undeniably resulted in a biased view, ignoring the fact that experiences are varied and more crucially, doing no justice to the boy. This is further compounded when his prejudice was taken as a personal attack by Juror 5 who lived in a slum before, engendering a flurry of emotions. In this regard, it is evident that perceptions and emotions are intricately entwined and it is crucial that we attack the problem, not the people (Fisher and Ury, 2012).

In light of varied perceptions, it is important that interests of individuals are made explicit. This is so as when we begin to ask ""WHY?"", inaccurate perceptions and selfish interests could be teased out, allowing us to see how each side has multiple interests. For example, within the ""Guilty"" side, a range of interests was noticed – where Juror 7's interest lied in wanting to ""get out of here"", while Juror 3's problematic interest stemmed from his strained relationship with his son. Insodoing, we would be able to correct inaccurate and biased perceptions, while respecting and understanding the basic concerns of others.

At the core of it, clear communication and active listening of interests, alongside values of respect and empathy, are crucial in ensuring efficiency and an improvement or maintenance of relationships.",men debat fate boy suspect kill father differ person array interest debat portray import listen understand respect empathi it vital disentangl percept emot problem a percept shape vari experi valu array percept undeni negoti howev allow percept determin view problem hand detriment lead obscur truth also inaccur basi upon make decis for exampl juror preconceiv prejudic slumdwel result experi live among vote guilti thi prejudic undeni result bias view ignor fact experi vari crucial justic boy thi compound prejudic taken person attack juror live slum engend flurri emot in regard evid percept emot intric entwin crucial attack problem peopl fisher uri in light vari percept import interest individu made explicit thi begin ask whi inaccur percept selfish interest could tea allow u see side multipl interest for exampl within guilti side rang interest notic juror interest lie want get juror problemat interest stem strain relationship son insodo would abl correct inaccur bias percept respect understand basic concern other at core clear commun activ listen interest alongsid valu respect empathi crucial ensur effici improv mainten relationship,Neutral

"A story about 12 men who come from different background, a different point of view, different goals, different motive, and different argument to act as juries facing a complicated murder case. When 11 of them thought it was an easy decision to make, there was also effort from Juror 8 (Henry Fonda) to reveal what was really happened with the case and save a boy's life form death sentence. This film shows what logic can do to break prejudice and how a single decision can decide on a boy's life.

Set of the place is one of the most important parts of a film. 12 Angry Men is unique because it only has one set of place located in the juror's room. But, if we thought this film will be boring because only has one set of place, we must be terribly wrong. Sidney Lumet has successfully directed the film with intense argument and interesting interaction between the jurors without forgetting ""the simpleness"" itself. All of the actors successfully drive their emotional expression towards the discussion. The dialogue is brilliant, genius, and remarkable, it makes all of the characters have their own signature and characteristics.

"Tarrant County Jury Services shows highlights from ""12 Angry Men"" to impress on you how important it is. However, I have already watched this movie several times. Even though I know the outcome it is interesting to speculate as to what the message each juror is trying to express.

Of course, just about all of Henry Fonda's performances are exceptional and in this one you see him sweat. The real tension in this movie is the interaction between the jurors.

"This is always worth a watch. Supremely acted across the board with special mention to Jack Warden and Joseph Sweeney. The tension mounts as the movie progresses as Henry Fonda puts doubt into the heads of his fellow jurors.

"The plot unfolds well, but the part Davis advocates is only vague speculation. In fact, after proving these things one by one, the child may or may not be the murderer.

It's a great honor to see someone take a screenshot and quote this short comment 11 years ago as a vulgar mass representative. Now I would like to add that it is one thing to say that the dereliction of duty by the organs of power. There is no fault in reasonable questioning, but there is a fault in the verdict of acquittal.

"Recently my housemate and I had a film marathon involving SCANNERS and TRUE LIES, two films I have seen before and will see again. After these two he suggested '12 Angry Men' a film I had never heard of before and wasn't really in the mood for. I was very wrong. The film itself is excellent and a true calling card for the classic and noir period. A period where anger is displayed through shouting, not shooting, and this shouting is done using the English language...not a flurry of abuse we are so used to these days. I am blathering I know BUT this film surprised me, made me laugh, worried me, interested me and angered me, all the things that a very good film really should do.

The fact that all of this came from a film where the characters are in one room for 98% of the run time is an even bigger example of the timelessness of the piece. I will be watching this again.

"I cannot believe I was forced to endure this movie in a class I took at college. Synopsis: 12 men sit in a room and talk for the ENTIRE movie. It's about as fun as sitting in the doctor's office listening to the chit-chat of other patients. I know it's supposed to be good since it has the noble purpose of pointing out the already obvious fact that some accused people, if the jury does not consider carefully all the evidence, will be wrongly convicted. Also, some of the ""evidence"" presented to defend the accused is sketchy, at best. It seems too many jurors have taken this movie to heart -- in this country we turn people like O.J. Simpson out on the street.

I might have liked to read this as a book, where I could at least dream up my own characters and give them more to do besides sit and talk. The two main characters were also pretty flat; one is your all-enlightened bleeding heart liberal who thinks a crack dealer that has been arrested 42 times will straighten up if given ""just one more shot at 'rehab'."" The other is the typical conservative loudmouth whose values are rock-solid and self-righteous and he's going to scream louder and louder until you agree with him. This movie isn't suspensful, it's laughable.

"12 angry men is a courtroom drama based on the premise that all defendants deserve a fair trial until proved guilty. The film is a very simplistic take on the presumption of innocence and takes place almost entirely within a small New York City court room as 12 men debate the fate of a young defendant charged with murdering his father. In the start all jurors think of the case as an open and shut case except one; Juror No. 8 played by Henry Fonda. But as they discuss the the available evidence, it turns out it is not simple as it seems to be. Most of the jurors are prejudiced and it takes the staunch effort from the character played by Fonda to induce logic and sense into the proceedings.

The film builds tension through conflict among the jurors and the dialogue. The length is only 95 minutes but it feels as if it is shot in real time. The direction and camera-work is excellent. The jurors are all well defined in terms of their personalities, occupations, prejudices and the emotional reasons behind those prejudices. All the cast members make an excellent effort into bringing these characters to life.

The movie is not about solving the crime although all the available evidence is heavily discussed, it is about the jury passing a judgment on the life of a boy. It is a take on the strength of the jury and their power to decide a man's survival and it performs this job in an excellent manner. The movie is a rare gem and I highly recommend it to anyone who loves great cinema.",angri men courtroom drama base premis defend deserv fair trial prove guilti the film simplist take presumpt innoc take place almost entir within small new york citi court room men debat fate young defend charg murder father in start juror think case open shut case except one juror no play henri fonda but discus avail evid turn simpl seem most juror prejud take staunch effort charact play fonda induc logic sen proceed the film build tension conflict among juror dialogu the length minut feel shot real time the direct camerawork excel the juror well defin term person occup prejudic emot reason behind prejudic all cast member make excel effort bring charact life the movi solv crime although avail evid heavili discus juri pas judgment life boy it take strength juri power decid man surviv perform job excel manner the movi rare gem i highli recommend anyon love great cinema,Positive
"The life is made up of choices we make every single day, from small things like what to eat for breakfast and what movie to watch in spare time to the big things like the vacation plans or mortgage engagements. We are so used to choosing we do it instantaneously, without any further investigations - and that is often the case with the things we think are right because if we are right it means that everyone else who thinks differently is wrong. People were, are and will always be stubborn and narrow-minded because they are a majority and one can only guess what will happen when that changes.

1957's ""12 angry men"" is a splendid courtroom drama which was a directorial debut for Sidney Lumet and starred an ensemble cast of great actors - Henry Fonda, Lee J. Cobb, Martin Balsam, Jack Klugman, Ed Begley and many others. The film is set almost entirely in one room where the jury must decide whether a man on trial for murder is guilty and it showcases all there is to love about the art of cinema: tensions, eloquent and well-thought out dialogues, outstanding performances, masterful camera work and most of all - the presence effect.

Together with the jurors we examine every piece of evidence, every statement, every witness so that not only they can come to the unanimous conclusion but also to put ourselves in the shoes of a person convicted and admit that there is a reasonable doubt and to state so in our final judgment, and it's no easy task. It's not difficult to stand out from the crowd but it's so much harder to stoop down to it everytime you're pressured into thinking, doing, believing something or behaving the way the rest is - you have to stand firmly where you are and be a human no matter what and maybe, just maybe, the angry people around you will see the whole picture more clearly.

Fighting to dominate the screen might be better phrasing than 'sharing' the screen.

"In spite of being recommended multiple times, I only got to watch this masterpiece during the months of quarantine in 2020 and I was really surprised. Alongside being a masterfully crafted film, the most important aspect was how this film was way ahead for its time being released in 1957.

It follows the tension between 12 jurors locked in a room who must arrive at a unanimous decision to convict an 18 year old who is accused of murdering his own father that at the first glance looks like an open and shut case. However, when one of them decides the other way, each one must face their own prejudices and moral burdens as reality is put into trial. It deals with multiple themes. most importantly the idea of democracy, racism, xenophobia and the dangers of preconceived ideas. The screenplay is sharp and the tension between the characters keeps you on the edge of your seat throughout the film.

"I completely recognize that 12 Angry Men is a classic, but it's just not my favorite old movie. If Lee J. Cobb didn't give such a fantastic performance, I wouldn't like it at all. As many plays do (although this movie was originally a television production and subsequently adapted to the stage), it has a definite message and tries as hard as possible to convince the audience that the writer is correct. Unfortunately, I wasn't convinced. I maintained my belief that in the United States of America, everyone is entitled to his own opinion. Lee J. Cobb nearly echoes this sentiment verbatim in the film, with extreme passion. Henry Fonda (and writer Reginald Rose) argue that in the United States, the ""reasonable doubt"" portion of the jury system is more important than every man's right to a different opinion.

In essence, the jury starts the film seemingly all decided to decide guilty to a murder trial. While giving their preliminary vote in the back room, Hank realizes he will be the only one with the power to prolong the discussion. If he votes guilty with the rest, the deliberation (and the movie) will be over. So, he votes not-guilty, and forces the other eleven men to re-think things. But it isn't really fair, if you're on Lee's side of the story. If you're on Team Hank, this might be one of your favorite movies of all time. A truly impartial jury is nearly impossible, as anyone who's ever had an opinion or life experience that shaped their views. Any of those twelve men is entitled to his opinion, but this film argues that peer pressure should be more powerful than individuality. As Hank brow-beats other jurors into voting not-guilty, Lee and a few others remain firm. Will it turn out to be a hung jury, or will the American justice system prevail?

One aspect of the film I will compliment is the setting. The movie starts with the jurors walking into the deliberation room, and the entire movie takes place there. We never see the trial or hear evidence; everything is the discussion. It's an interesting style, because the point is not for the audience to get involved in the case or to make up their own minds. The point is, as mentioned, that if the jury has a reasonable doubt, they must acquit. The cast is also a great asset to the film. All professionals, all giving their unique characters their all - although I do wish the original lead from television was kept on for the movie. Franchot Tone can act circles around Henry Fonda, and he has integrity, passion, and class; he was traded in for a monotonous, whiny voiced bad actor.

Still, Martin Balsam, John Fiedler, E. G. Marshall, Jack Klugman, Edward Binns, Jack Warden, Joseph Sweeney, Ed Begley, George Voskovec, Robert Webber, and of course, Lee J. Cobb, are exactly what the film calls for. Lee couldn't have been any better, and it pained us at the Hot Toasty Rag Awards that he didn't take home the newspaper award for Best Supporting Actor.

"I realized, watching ""12 Angry Men,"" what an intensely political film it is. The term ""ahead of its time,"" is one I try to avoid, since no person, whether artist or businessman, is ahead of their time. They are, inextricably, unavoidably, a part of their time. But this is a film made in 1957--that's a pretty long time ago, culturally speaking--and it's still inarguably timely. The lead character, Henry Fonda (Juror #8), tries to force people out of making a decision based solely on race and personal convenience. The jury is deliberating a murder conviction, a young immigrant accused of stabbing his father, with ample circumstantial evidence that any ""good"" citizen could stand by if they needed to justify their vote. Most of the jury member want to get the decision over and done with hastily; they have personal errands on their minds, games they want to watch, people they prefer to see. And it's hot that day, very hot--air conditioning is not an option. Under these conditions, Fonda asks much of his fellow jurors: he asks them to put aside thier usual concerns for their own schedules; he demands that they dislodge many years of easy prejudices corroding their judgment; he pleads that they take the time to try and reconstruct other people's points of view, something most of these men clearly don't make a habit of. It's poignant toward the conclusion, after the men leave the courthouse, when one man admiringly asks Fonda his name. They exhange surnames, and then part, realizing either that they're incapable of small talk with each other after such a momentous moral experience--or perhaps that they have nothing in common now that they've emerged into the light of day.

I don't think Lumet is viewed as political filmmaker as he truly is. ""12 Angry Men"" was his film debut, an astonishing accomplishment. But think of many of his subsequent films: a documentary on Martin Luther King's journeys; ""Serpico,"" which charts the crusade of a copy compelled to question an entrenched system that wasn't working very well; the ""Pawnbroker,"" is another powerful film, about how a concentration camp survivor tries to avoid dealing with the moral complications of the outside world once he's back in it; ""Dog Day Afternoon"" is about a character who is fed up with not having enough money for all the human responsibilities pulling at him. The protagonists in these films are all people that confront or have confronted systems of discrimination, be they racial or economic. And there is nothing more political than examining tyrannies. It's a brave body of work, one to be admired, and ""12 Angry Men"" is a great place to start.",i realiz watch angri men intens polit film the term ahead time one i tri avoid sinc person whether artist businessman ahead time they inextric unavoid part time but film made that pretti long time ago cultur speakingand still inargu time the lead charact henri fonda juror tri forc peopl make decis base sole race person conveni the juri deliber murder convict young immigr accus stab father ampl circumstanti evid good citizen could stand need justifi vote most juri member want get decis done hastili person errand mind game want watch peopl prefer see and hot day hotair condit option under condit fonda ask much fellow juror ask put asid thier usual concern schedul demand dislodg mani year easi prejudic corrod judgment plead take time tri reconstruct peopl point view someth men clearli dont make habit it poignant toward conclus men leav courthous one man admiringli ask fonda name they exhang surnam part realiz either theyr incap small talk moment moral experienceor perhap noth common theyv emerg light day i dont think lumet view polit filmmak truli angri men film debut astonish accomplish but think mani subsequ film documentari martin luther king journey serpico chart crusad copi compel question entrench system wasnt work well pawnbrok anoth power film concentr camp survivor tri avoid deal moral complic outsid world he back dog day afternoon charact fed enough money human respons pull the protagonist film peopl confront confront system discrimin racial econom and noth polit examin tyranni it brave bodi work one admir angri men great place start,Positive
"First thing the defendant was guilty in ""12 Angry Men,"". However, this movie exposes the huge flaws in the jury system. Even when evidence and testimony supports a guilty verdict a single self-righteous bully swayed the decisions of other jurors,

Juror 8 is portrayed as a champion of justice, but his methods of jury tampering by introducing an identical knife and speculating on witness testimonies, steps beyond courtroom protocols. He dismisses the old man's account and makes assumptions about the female witness's eyesight all based on personal experiments and conjecture, not verified evidence.

Juror 8's tactics and amateur detective work, created bias on the jury with emotional appeals rather than sticking to the trial facts, and undermining the judicial process.

"Yep this movie is so great. The tension of the characters draws the audience in from the start. We imagine that the case is open and shut, 11 me saying guilty and 1 not. We feel the discomfort of Henry Fonda as the other characters belittle and mock how he can see any reasonable doubt in the case. But we also share his victories and the enthusiasm as he proceeds to refute or add doubt to the arguments for guilty and are captivated and draw in as other jurors begin to see doubt in the proceedings.

The audience can also see the arguments for guilty and wonder if Fonda's character is correct in saying that he doubts. Yet they also feel the shame of the characters as he disproves that a previously sound theory is iron tight, joining his side as members of the jury do.

On top of this they are wonderfully woven in human elements such as the misconceptions that influence people and the growing tension between different characters. This is brought to life even more by the amazing performances, Fonda, Lee J Cobb and Joseph Sweeney are of particular note.

I started watching this film on a bored relaxed laying about day but by the end i was on the edge of the seat with my hands on my knees feeling more tense than a politician on results day.

"In the overheated jury room of the New York County Courthouse, a jury prepares to deliberate the case of an 18-year-old impoverished youth accused of stabbing his father to death. The judge instructs them that if there is any reasonable doubt, the jurors are to return a verdict of not guilty. If found guilty, the defendant will receive a death sentence. The verdict must be unanimous. The evidence at first seems convincing. A neighbor testified to witnessing the defendant stab his father from her window. Another neighbor testified that he heard the defendant threaten to kill his father and the father's body hitting the ground, and then, through his peephole, saw the defendant run past his door. The boy has a violent past and had recently purchased a switchblade of the same type as was found at the murder scene, but claimed he lost his. The knife at the scene had been cleaned of fingerprints. In a preliminary vote, all jurors vote guilty except Juror 8, who believes that there should be some discussion before the verdict is made. He questions the reliability of the witnesses. Producing his own switchblade, he throws doubt on the supposed uniqueness of the murder weapon. He says he cannot vote guilty because reasonable doubt exists. Juror 8 suggests a secret ballot, from which he will abstain; if all the other jurors still vote guilty, he will acquiesce. The ballot reveals one not guilty vote. Juror 9 reveals that he changed his vote, agreeing there should be more discussion. Juror 8 argues that the noise of a passing train would have obscured the threat the second witness claimed to have overheard. Juror 5 changes his vote, as does Juror 11, who believes the defendant, had he truly killed his father, would not have returned to the crime scene several hours later to retrieve the murder weapon as it had already been cleaned of fingerprints. Juror 8 points out that people often say ""I'm going to kill you"" without literally meaning it. Jurors 5, 6, and 8 further question the second witness's story. Juror 3 is infuriated, and after a verbal argument, tries to attack Juror 8, shouting ""I'll kill him!"". Juror 8 points out that this proves his point about the defendant's words. Jurors 2 and 6 change their votes; the jury is now evenly split. Juror 4 doubts the defendant's alibi, based on the boy's inability to recall certain details. Juror 8 tests Juror 4's own memory. He is able to remember events from the previous week, with some difficulty. Jurors 2, 3, and 8 debate whether the defendant could have stabbed his much-taller father from a downward angle, eventually deciding it was physically possible, though awkward. Juror 5 points out that someone who knew how to use a switchblade would have stabbed underhand at an upwards angle. Impatient to leave, Juror 7 changes his vote and is confronted by Juror 11; Juror 7 insists, albeit unconvincingly, that he thinks the defendant is not guilty. Jurors 1 and 12 also change their votes, leaving only three guilty votes. Juror 10 erupts in racially motivated vitriol. The rest of the jurors turn their backs to him and Juror 4 tells him to sit down and be quiet. Juror 4 declares that the woman who saw the killing from across the street stands as solid evidence. Juror 12 reverts back to a guilty vote. Juror 9 realizes that the witness, coming from bed, would not have had time to put on her glasses in time to see the assault occur, making her story dubious. The remaining jurors, except Juror 3, change their vote to not guilty. Juror 3 gives an increasingly tortured string of arguments, building on earlier remarks about his strained relationship with his own son. In a moment of rage, Juror 3 tears up a photograph of him and his son before breaking down sobbing. He mutters not guilty, making the vote unanimous. As the others leave, Juror 8 helps the distraught Juror 3 with his coat. The defendant is found not guilty off-screen and the jurors leave the courthouse. In a brief epilogue, Jurors 8 and 9 introduce each other for the first time by their names before parting.",in overh juri room new york counti courthous juri prepar deliber case yearold impoverish youth accus stab father death the judg instruct reason doubt juror return verdict guilti if found guilti defend receiv death sentenc the verdict must unanim the evid first seem convinc a neighbor testifi wit defend stab father window anoth neighbor testifi heard defend threaten kill father father bodi hit ground peephol saw defend run past door the boy violent past recent purchas switchblad type found murder scene claim lost the knife scene clean fingerprint in preliminari vote juror vote guilti except juror believ discus verdict made he question reliabl wit produc switchblad throw doubt suppos uniqu murder weapon he say cannot vote guilti reason doubt exist juror suggest secret ballot abstain juror still vote guilti acquiesc the ballot reveal one guilti vote juror reveal chang vote agre discus juror argu nois pas train would obscur threat second wit claim overheard juror chang vote juror believ defend truli kill father would return crime scene sever hour later retriev murder weapon alreadi clean fingerprint juror point peopl often say im go kill without liter mean juror question second witness stori juror infuri verbal argument tri attack juror shout ill kill juror point prove point defend word juror chang vote juri evenli split juror doubt defend alibi base boy inabl recal certain detail juror test juror memori he abl rememb event previou week difficulti juror debat whether defend could stab muchtal father downward angl eventu decid physic possibl though awkward juror point someon knew use switchblad would stab underhand upward angl impati leav juror chang vote confront juror juror insist albeit unconvincingli think defend guilti juror also chang vote leav three guilti vote juror erupt racial motiv vitriol the rest juror turn back juror tell sit quiet juror declar woman saw kill across street stand solid evid juror revert back guilti vote juror realiz wit come bed would time put glass time see assault occur make stori dubiou the remain juror except juror chang vote guilti juror give increasingli tortur string argument build earlier remark strain relationship son in moment rage juror tear photograph son break sob he mutter guilti make vote unanim a other leav juror help distraught juror coat the defend found guilti offscreen juror leav courthous in brief epilogu juror introduc first time name part,Neutral

This movie should be even shown in film schools as a textbook example of how to make a movie without special effects but only with a good script and talented actors. That's it: a movie shot in black and white and for almost all the time the film is set in a small room.

"A courtroom drama which spends about a minute inside an actual courtroom, ""12 Angry Men"" defies expectations in other ways, too, most particularly by not being a star vehicle despite starring Henry Fonda.

It's a bit of a Trojan Horse, too; screenwriter Reginald Rose making his case against the death penalty by showing a kid who appears guilty of having stabbed his father in a moment of rage and encouraging us to root for jury nullification, a la OJ, because he shouldn't have to die for his crime. If the charge wasn't first-degree murder and execution not concomitant with a guilty verdict, we might see the pesky Mr. Davis (Fonda) and his tireless ""supposing"" not much differently than does angry Juror #3 (Lee J. Cobb).

""It's now your duty to sit down and try and separate the facts from the fancy,"" a supremely bored judge tells the jury at the start of the movie.

But a lot of ""fancy"" gets tossed around in the jury room, not just ethnic slurs from Juror #10 (Ed Begley) and baseball chatter from Juror #7 (Jack Warden), two solid early votes for conviction. Much of the fancy comes from Davis himself, who asks the other jurors to accept an odd set of coincidences and aspersions in order to ignore the stubborn fact that someone walked into a man's apartment and stabbed him to death with the same kind of switchblade that had belonged to his angry son.

""This kid's been kicked around all his life,"" Davis says. ""He's had a pretty miserable 18 years. I think we owe him a few words.""

Does anyone really believe this should work? Well, in ""12 Angry Men"" it does, aided by Rose's clever manipulation, Sidney Lumet's seamless but unshowy directing, and a performance by Fonda that demonstrates his egoless mastery of the screen acting craft at its near-height. The supporting cast is great, too, even the underdiscussed ones like Ed Binns' salt-of-the-earth painter #6 and Robert Webber's marketing whizkid #12, who apparently invents Rice Krispies before our very eyes.

The script does have its weak moments, none worse than when #10 goes off on his unfortunate diatribe regarding ""them"", in which all but two of his fellows leave their seats and symbolically turn away from him. A Richard Thomas stage production I saw handled this awkward business more cleverly. The music is a collection of ugly off-notes, and much of the background chatter is unconvincing.

""12 Angry Men"" does have terrific setwork and piercing character moments, like how stuffy stockbroker #4 (E.G. Marshall) sniffily ignores #3's attempt to hand him a business card. Cobb as #3 is stuck with the most over-the-top moments, but sells them well. Cobb could yell with the best of them, and proves it here.

But ""12 Angry Men"", while a good movie, is not great film, pushing a dubious rooting interest for a killer's freedom.

"Eighth grade was my first exposure to 12 Angry Men. My class was reading it as a play, I read the lines of juror number eleven. Shortly after the conclusion of our class read, we watched the film adaptation. I was in eighth grade, I knew it was a great film, but I didn't understand the brilliance of it that I see today. 12 Angry Men's greatest creative strength is the direction- technically. Sidney Lumet has every shot in every scene fitting together creating an effortless flow for the film. However, the greatest weakness the picture has is its hard for the viewer to really settle their inner roots in the it for some reason. The directing doesn't transport our emotions until the second half of the film.

The Good Wife produced en episode in their first season titled Doubt. In a show that studies a defense attorney's efforts to create doubt in a jury's mind, the process of the jury members consolations are shown. I thought it was a brilliant move and we should see more media centric things about juries. That episode glimmers with inspiration from 12 Angry Men, but it lacks the morality, mystery, and humanity found in the play. People mistake character development for spending mass amounts of time with a particular character. I believe character development is to I understand a character, the writing and actor thoroughly explain the person on the page to me. 12 Angry Men develops twelve characters in ninety minutes without even knowing their names.

As each juror slowly changes their verdict in 12 Angry Men, near the middle of the film I was struck, seeing a metaphor occurring mid-film. It all goes back to politics, the jurors willing to believe that the boy on trial is innocent are the liberals and the men who close their mind to any possibility of innocence represent the conservative party. The jurors who may have been judged for the way they talk, what ethnicity they are, their sexual orientation, or if they were just plain old sensitive were the ones who opened their minds up to Juror 7's campaign to examine the case thoroughly. Now 12 Angry Men still lives back in the days where life was religion-centric and things were one way, and one way one only. This is a move that makes 12 Angry Men ahead of its time.

12 Angry Men is a slice to how a jury actually acts to some extent. The thing they always forget, when their minds are clouded with things in their life they are missing due to their obligation to the justice system, is they hold the fate of another man's life. It's not something that can be taken lightly. Reasonable doubt is mistaken with something that proves the accused not guilty. That's not true and 12 Angry Men shines a light on that discussion. What this film is about to me is the laziness, selfishness, and our personal bias hiding our judgment. We all need to take a step back sometimes and really look at the situation for the gray, not black or white. Even laughing here and there, 12 Angry Men is something that may not be the most fun film to watch, but it's certainly an important to see.

"I kind of feel like i'm in no position to judge this film, because that is what a review is after all, judgment. The reason i feel unworthy of reviewing this picture is because it is one of the best films ever made and i can not say that about too many films. This film is a study on the nature of man and all of what he thinks. It's a study on why we take action about pretty much anything. Beneath all the convincing and lecturing, the main character shows more than that: the psychology of the masses, the prejudice and it's roots, the mixed feelings of thinking that you're doing good even when not sure if you are and so many more. I don't really want to get in to the story of the film, not only because the film offers a quick and grabbing pull into it's universe, but also for not wanting to ruin the experience of meeting the cosmos that Sidney Lumet orchestrated for the audience. This is one picture that deserves it's place in the books of cinema history and in my opinion, a great 1957 masterpiece.",i kind feel like im posit judg film review judgment the reason feel unworthi review pictur one best film ever made say mani film thi film studi natur man think it studi take action pretti much anyth beneath convinc lectur main charact show psycholog mass prejudic root mix feel think your good even sure mani i dont realli want get stori film film offer quick grab pull univers also want ruin experi meet cosmo sidney lumet orchestr audienc thi one pictur deserv place book cinema histori opinion great masterpiec,Positive

My takeaway from this movie is we all have our own influences based on our lives and sometimes we are way too quick to judge based on this.

"12 Angry men is a film in which maybe those over 25 would enjoy. It explores prejudices and preconceived notions which people had in the 1950s. Actors such as Henry Fonda, Lee J. Cobb, Martin Balsam, Jack Klugman, Jack Warden, E.G. Marshall, and Ed Begley give good performances and make their characters believable. Without these good performances, it could have been a boring movie with meaningless discussions in the jury room and in the court room. These talented actors bring life to the movies. The movie could edit out 5-10 minutes. It is a classic so it warrants watching. Otherwise, a bit slow. The movie had a predictable outcome.Watch it alone for the performance of it best actor, Henry Fonda.",angri men film mayb would enjoy it explor prejudic preconceiv notion peopl actor henri fonda lee j cobb martin balsam jack klugman jack warden eg marshal ed begley give good perform make charact believ without good perform could bore movi meaningless discus juri room court room these talent actor bring life movi the movi could edit minut it classic warrant watch otherwis bit slow the movi predict outcomewatch alon perform best actor henri fonda,Positive
"I can't believe I was hooked for every second of such a simple movie. I didn't know what to expect going into the film, I just knew it is always on top of the rankings of the best movies of all time. I was pleasantly surprised that a movie with no action at all, no mind-bending plot, and what could seem like a very boring setting, could have me so invested and on the edge of my seat. The film flows perfectly and makes you feel as if you are there, like you are Juror #13 trying to come up with arguments to convince everyone else. One thing I liked a lot is that every juror has a strictly unique personality, and can only be convinced in a specific way. But what puts that movie up there for me is that you never know if the kid was or wasn't guilty. Throughout the movie, Juror #8 remarks that it is possible to be right or wrong, and with the information they have, nothing can be taken for granted. It ultimately comes to what is morally correct, having an innocent kid killed or letting a murderer out in the streets. It makes you realize how easily can people, who have nothing to win or lose, go over important details when there's a lot at stake. A true classic.",i cant believ i hook everi second simpl movi i didnt know expect go film i knew alway top rank best movi time i pleasantli surpris movi action mindbend plot could seem like bore set could invest edg seat the film flow perfectli make feel like juror tri come argument convinc everyon el one thing i like lot everi juror strictli uniqu person convinc specif way but put movi never know kid wasnt guilti throughout movi juror remark possibl right wrong inform noth taken grant it ultim come moral correct innoc kid kill let murder street it make realiz easili peopl noth win lose go import detail there lot stake a true classic,Positive
"In my opinion, Before you judging someone or something, please see this movie and Learn how to judge.

Even though it was made in the 1950s you can easily apply this film to today's society as its overall message and values it conveys to the audience, such as prejudice and how everyone will interpret a situation differently. I love the cinematography in this film especially the opening scene as the credits are rolling as it is one take and it just adds to show us the claustrophobia these men must be feeling as they are all cramped together in a small hot room for hours.

"Old movies probably don't get the kind of respect that they should. There was a time when being an actor was more than just a sign you were wealthy, it was a sign you were talented as hell. The whole cast in this movie is nothing short of amazing. Between that and a great story, 12 angry men although made in 1957 is just as culturally relevant and important today as it was back then.

The story finds 12 nameless jurors(at least until the end anyway) deliberating over a boy who is supposedly guilty as hell over the murder of his own father. Suffice to say, almost all 12 men(remember, this was the 1950's) want to convict this boy. The lone holdout wants to go over the evidence a little more because something inside him says maybe it's worth it because they're deciding a boy's fate, and that it's not something to be so casual about.

The ensuing two hours of the film features some great twists, great turns, and remarkable humanity on display by all these wonderful actors, portraying very flawed but very relatable human beings. In the end, what really makes this movie works is that 12 men understood what responsibility truly means... so I guess this is kind of like Spiderman... times 12.

All jokes aside, 12 Angry Men is a classic and is worthy of being shown at film schools not just because it demonstrates compelling acting, great story, amazing emotion and even character growth... by most of the main cast.

"Good legal drama but the evidence brought to our attention by juror no. 8 (Henry Fonda) is often not especially convincing but seems to be taken very seriously by progressively more and more men in the room until inevitably we have a unanimous Not Guilty verdict. An example of this, is when Fonda successfully gets the others to acknowledge that the old man witness is unreliable, yet then goes on to base a major part of his own evidence on the old fellows testimony that he took fifteen seconds to get to the door to witness the murderer fleeing. Fonda clearly assumes that this man he has determined as unreliable would get his exact timings spot on in a moment of heightened emotion. It may seem like a minor point but there are just a little too many of these small inconsistent assumptions littering 12 Angry Men for me to feel it was an entirely successful exercise. I really couldn't help shake the notion that Fonda's character had his own agenda and was simply unwilling to back down. Perhaps he was the most persuasive man in the room and that was ultimately the reason that the decision was made. It's difficult to really say with any certainty that the accused was innocent at all.

Although people of my generation we tend to watch modern films but I have a special place in my heart for classics as well, It was when I surfed around the Internet looking for something good to watch. Then I stumble upon this title '12 Angry Men' I didn't think of it as much so I thought I will just give it a try. As it started I have to be honest I wasn't paying much attention first but as the movie progressed I kind of got engaged to the whole argument the men were having from that point I got sucked in to the film.

"A black-and-white film released in 1957, 12 Angry Men was nevertheless one that can captivate its modern audience despite the fact that the entirety of the film was practically shot in a Jury room and consisted of just dialogues. Yet, it may be precisely on this ground that it was able to illustrate clearly to the audience the importance of overcoming our implicit prejudices to arrive at a successful negotiation. Without dictating any Jurors to take up an extreme 'bad guy' role (these are characters and personalities that we often see in our everyday lives), the film further attempts to draw parallels from the Jury room to the real world through urging us to reflect on our prejudices as we go through the hum-drums of our everyday lives.",a blackandwhit film releas angri men nevertheless one captiv modern audienc despit fact entireti film practic shot juri room consist dialogu yet may precis ground abl illustr clearli audienc import overcom implicit prejudic arriv success negoti without dictat juror take extrem bad guy role charact person often see everyday live film attempt draw parallel juri room real world urg u reflect prejudic go humdrum everyday live,Negative

"I guess the message of this movie is timeless, especially in the modern world, in this modern times. So I am republishing it. For all the Journalism and Mass Comm student, no make it, for everyone who is with even a little but of a democratic mind set, this movie is a must watch.

I was doing a case study in my Mass-Communication class, when I came upon an old 1957 movie named ""12 angry men"". Who would have thought that a monochromatic film about a Spanish boy accused of murder, and the dilemma of the Jury could be such an experience? ""12 angry men"" was such a lucid, tense, and strangely realistic thriller.

The story is pretty contrived - during a murder trial, one man's (Henry Fonda) doubts about the accused's guilt gradually overcome the rather less-than-democratic prejudices of the other eleven members of the jury. While the film itself points out that democracy and all its human participants are flawed in nature, it upholds the values of democracy, probably in a way which is very much apt to the time. The jurors were named after numbers, very much in sync with ideal democracy, and the photography, being black and white, heightens the tension.

Taking place in almost entirely a jury room, the film was very economical, 12 angry men watches as 11 jurors, convinced of the boys guilt, are slowly won over by one man sympathetic enough to at least looking into the matter, and having reasonable doubts before sending a man to die..the tagline of the movie sums it up...""life in their hands, death on their minds"". The screenplay, happening almost entirely in a single room, in a hot summer afternoon, adds on to the claustrophobia, and rather being confining and acts as a tension and drama building measure.

The film leaves a tremendous impact, and leaves a person wondering, about the inevitability as well as the futility of democracy.

"In the movie, 12 jurors were faced with a grave situation, which was to decide whether an 18-year-old should be found guilty of murder and given the death penalty. By watching their struggles in forming consensus, it shone light on the process of negotiations. The movie, primarily driven by the emotions of the jurors exhibit characteristics that impede the course of negotiations. Be it for dramatic effect, the jurors seem to have difficulties separating people from the problem on several occasions, with their emotions overwhelming them. The acting in 12 angry men is terrific, with the men portraying the true and loaded emotions that occur when there are disagreements. There are many lessons to be learnt from the negotiations process. For instance, Juror 10's underlying prejudice and preconceived notions can be observed when he said that slums were breeding grounds for criminals and were 'dirty'. Disapproval of his prejudiced views was clear as the other jurors turned their backs against him and disregarded his opinions, reminding him not to let it cloud his judgement. The movie is a true rleflection of what negotiations could be like in real-world scenarios, and it is important for us to take away some valuable skills from it",in movi juror face grave situat decid whether yearold found guilti murder given death penalti by watch struggl form consensu shone light process negoti the movi primarili driven emot juror exhibit characterist imped cours negoti be dramat effect juror seem difficulti separ peopl problem sever occas emot overwhelm the act angri men terrif men portray true load emot occur disagr there mani lesson learnt negoti process for instanc juror underli prejudic preconceiv notion observ said slum breed ground crimin dirti disapprov prejud view clear juror turn back disregard opinion remind let cloud judgement the movi true rleflect negoti could like realworld scenario import u take away valuabl skill,Neutral

"I will not go in normal review of the movie. It had been brilliant. There were loopholes, but not in the plot, but in the prosecution. There are more than reasonable doubt of the boy being not guilty and he most certainly was, along with the points made by the defense (jurors) there were several other missed points, which the stories said, but weren't used for defense. The movie brilliantly brings out, when the cops wants to make a scapegoat of someone who doesn't have means to defend, how easily they can. The defense lawyer, as mentioned during discussions, was an unwilling completely disinterested and somehow wanted to go over the ordeal. Probably a case of 'Court Appointed' - a la ""You volunteer"" of An Officer And A gentleman. The glaring inconsistencies, which the juror noticed, and some they didn't were not noticed by him. However that isn't the brilliance of the movie, but it is its real life depiction of a upper echelon policy meeting, especially Board Meetings of a company. I am in a position vouch for that. Probably, if not already, this movie should be a part of mandatory curriculum of any business school. There the CEO has brought an agenda, ably supported by his/her team (the prosecutors). It is in Board, and usually the way it happens, all are very convinced of the power point presentation and the golden future the schemes will lead to. Unless one has a doubt and express it, the scheme will move on, till probably it is too late (boy past and beyond chair).

It is only when one says ""I am not too sure"" the discussions take place and various lacunae and wrong assumptions come to surface. In business, those are taken (sometimes) positively to plug the loopholes and polish the proposal (here of course there were no midway) but still the dynamics of a business meeting was replicated. The members with their own personal opinions (back grounds, prejudices), changing courts, on one side and again on other side, as the respective prejudices were addressed by the two opposing camps. Though all the background of each were not clearly brought out, but still one could guess, from their prejudices. Change the topic, and as I said it is a board meet.

"""12 Angry Men,"" directed by Sidney Lumet and released in 1957, is a timeless courtroom drama that transcends its genre to explore profound themes of justice, prejudice, and the moral responsibilities of a jury. Set almost entirely within a single room, the film unfolds as twelve jurors deliberate the fate of a young defendant accused of murder. What begins as a seemingly straightforward case quickly evolves into a gripping exploration of bias, doubt, and human integrity.

The film's strength lies in its exceptional writing and directing. Reginald Rose's script masterfully navigates the intense dynamics within the jury, illuminating how personal experiences, emotions, and prejudices can cloud judgment. Each juror is richly characterized, with distinct personalities and backgrounds that shape their perspectives on the case.

Henry Fonda, who plays Juror #8, stands out as the lone voice advocating for reasonable doubt. His performance is both poignant and resolute, embodying the ideal of justice through his unwavering commitment to truth. Fonda's character serves as a moral compass throughout the film, challenging the other jurors to confront their biases and reconsider the evidence presented.

The ensemble cast features remarkable performances from actors like Lee J. Cobb, Ed Begley, and Jack Klugman, each bringing depth to their characters. As tensions rise and tempers flare, the claustrophobic setting of the jury room creates an atmosphere of palpable tension, expertly captured by Lumet's direction. The film's cinematography, with its clever use of close-ups and varying angles, enhances the emotional stakes and keeps viewers engrossed.

""12 Angry Men"" not only serves as a gripping narrative but also acts as a profound social commentary. The film highlights the fragility of the justice system and the importance of civic duty. It poses critical questions regarding the nature of guilt and innocence, the impact of socio-economic backgrounds, and the significance of empathy in decision-making.

Despite being over six decades old, ""12 Angry Men"" remains remarkably relevant, as the issues it tackles-prejudice, accountability, and the morality of judgment-continue to resonate in contemporary society. It invites audiences to engage in introspection while examining their own biases and the importance of standing up for what is right.

""12 Angry Men"" is a cinematic masterpiece that combines brilliant writing, stellar performances, and a compelling narrative to create a thought-provoking experience. Its exploration of justice and human nature is as relevant today as it was at its release, making it a must-see film for anyone interested in the complexities of morality and the ethical dilemmas faced within the justice system.

"This is regarded as one of the best films ever made and I see why.

12 Angry Men is about a jury of twelve men who decide whether a boy is guilty of a murder or not. Everyone finds him guilty except for Juror 8 who believes there's reasonable doubt leading the rest of the jury to question their decisions.

By the end of its 96 minute runtime, I was completely blown away. For a film so limited in scale, I couldn't believe how suspenseful and incredible this film was. The majority of this film takes place in one room and it's masterful how well made it is. As the opening credits roll, Sidney Lumet tracks the camera in one single take, introducing us to every character and helping us get a first impression of what they're like. It's an outstanding beginning that establishes Lumet's talent. Lumet makes use of the one location to its full potential. The way some scenes are shot and edited make for some extremely tension filled moments that managed to surprise me in every way. There is not a single dull moment. As it progresses, the suspense goes up a notch leaving my eyes glued to the screen for its entirety. It's especially impressive considering this was Lumet's feature film debut. Could you get a better debut than this?!

For a film taking place in one room, a lot of dialogue is thrown around in what I consider to be one of the best scripts to ever be written. Reginald Rose's script astounds me. Not only am I dazzled by the way Rose unfolds this case but also how much it revealed certain details about the characters. He's very smart in framing the opinions of each of the men and why they have that opinion, leading to some emotionally powerful scenes that disclose reasons as to why some members think the boy is guilty excluding the evidence presented. This is a script that writers will dream of writing and I have to praise Reginald Rose for achieving this feat. Aside from the script and direction, the performances is the icing on the cake. Every single person puts their best foot forward and delivers incredible performances. Henry Fonda stands out as Juror 8 and is extremely compelling to watch. Lee J. Cobb is another standout who gets better and better as the film continues. Bit by bit, we learn how troubled of a person he is and Cobb steals the show during those intense scenes.

I now see why 12 Angry Men is loved so much. This is a film and ensemble piece that has it all. It's outstanding on every single level whether it's the performances, the script or the direction. This is a work of art that should be watched by everyone!",thi regard one best film ever made i see angri men juri twelv men decid whether boy guilti murder everyon find guilti except juror believ there reason doubt lead rest juri question decis by end minut runtim i complet blown away for film limit scale i couldnt believ suspens incred film the major film take place one room master well made a open credit roll sidney lumet track camera one singl take introduc u everi charact help u get first impress theyr like it outstand begin establish lumet talent lumet make use one locat full potenti the way scene shot edit make extrem tension fill moment manag surpris everi way there singl dull moment a progress suspens goe notch leav eye glu screen entireti it especi impress consid lumet featur film debut could get better debut for film take place one room lot dialogu thrown around i consid one best script ever written reginald rose script astound not i dazzl way rose unfold case also much reveal certain detail charact he smart frame opinion men opinion lead emot power scene disclos reason member think boy guilti exclud evid present thi script writer dream write i prais reginald rose achiev feat asid script direct perform ice cake everi singl person put best foot forward deliv incred perform henri fonda stand juror extrem compel watch lee j cobb anoth standout get better better film continu bit bit learn troubl person cobb steal show intens scene i see angri men love much thi film ensembl piec it outstand everi singl level whether perform script direct thi work art watch everyon,Positive

"As a directional debut, you could do worse than Sidney Lumet's excellent '12 Angry Men'. It would be the beginning of an illustrious career, even though perhaps the heights of his debut would never quite be reached again.

12 Angry Men is, apart from several opening shots, closing shots and a couple of scenes in a side room, filmed completely in one single room. To create a fascinating, character driven & tension filled picture can be quite difficult for some directors with this knowledge, but Lumet's direction here is world class. He uses the single location to enhance the feeling of claustrophobia, which also enhances a feeling of tension as all characters grow angrier as the film progresses. Much has been said about Lumet's use of camera angles to enhance the mood in our characters, such as the fact that the camera is generally placed at higher angles during the first act of the film, and gradually seems to be placed lower and lower towards the end, as more people are convinced of the 'not guilty' vote, so the camera emphasizes their superiority over the 'guilty' voters. Even though the film is largely in a single room, Lumet also uses weather conditions as a mood setter, with the setting being in a heatwave of some kind, and when the tables start turning towards the end in terms of the votes, the weather switches to pouring rain, which is generally an even larger symbolism of 'chaos', and that is precisely what is going on during the final moments of this picture.

12 Angry Men is also undoubtedly one of the best acted films in cinematic history, with in particular Lee J. Cobb giving the performance of a lifetime. This is not just an angry character, thriving on nihilistic thoughts and hating on everything that happens, but a tragic character that is prejudiced due to his strained relationship with his own son. This brings forth another point, which are ofcourse all twelve characters. All of these characters have some kind of background, origin, and all of them behave very differently and according to their personal lives and experiences. An opening shot of the room featuring all of the jurors entering and bantering with eachother already gives the audience an idea as to what kind of people these jurors are. All the while Lumet uses very long takes, switching between mid-shots & wide-shots in single takes to create the most immersive and personal experience possible. Later in the film, when things start to heat up even more, he also induces a fantastic use of the close-up, which is ofcourse generally the most personal and direct of shot compositions.

Furthermore, the screenplay by Reginald Rose is also a phenomenal addition to this film, as every single line of dialogue, character building and general confrontations enhance the tension significantly. Ofcourse, we do not get to witness extraordinary production design or scale due to the simplistic setting, but it is hard to imagine what Lumet could have done even better considering the material he was given.

Due to Lumet's technical expertise, visual mood setters, claustrophic atmosphere & the fantastic energetic acting, it feels as a 'thriller' in a drama setting. Ofcourse the fact that the audience does not know anything about the case beforehand also helps, since the viewer will be even more compelled to follow the discussions used in this picture, because we do not know anything about the case yet. In the end, whether or not the kid is guilty is shown to be quite irrelevant, as this film is mainly a message about the interference of personal prejudice in terms of law. Every character, however, is displayed as having some kind of humane reason as to why they think a certain way. Even Juror #3, who, as stated before, relates the kid in question to his own relationship with his son.

As one of the best-acted films of all time, combined with a fantastic screenplay, impeccable direction, in depth character development and characterization, 12 Angry Men is no doubt one of the greatest directional debuts ever made.",a direct debut could wors sidney lumet excel angri men it would begin illustri career even though perhap height debut would never quit reach angri men apart sever open shot close shot coupl scene side room film complet one singl room to creat fascin charact driven tension fill pictur quit difficult director knowledg lumet direct world class he use singl locat enhanc feel claustrophobia also enhanc feel tension charact grow angrier film progress much said lumet use camera angl enhanc mood charact fact camera gener place higher angl first act film gradual seem place lower lower toward end peopl convinc guilti vote camera emphas superior guilti voter even though film larg singl room lumet also use weather condit mood setter set heatwav kind tabl start turn toward end term vote weather switch pour rain gener even larger symbol chao precis go final moment pictur angri men also undoubtedli one best act film cinemat histori particular lee j cobb give perform lifetim thi angri charact thrive nihilist thought hate everyth happen tragic charact prejud due strain relationship son thi bring forth anoth point ofcours twelv charact all charact kind background origin behav differ accord person live experi an open shot room featur juror enter banter eachoth alreadi give audienc idea kind peopl juror all lumet use long take switch midshot wideshot singl take creat immers person experi possibl later film thing start heat even also induc fantast use closeup ofcours gener person direct shot composit furthermor screenplay reginald rose also phenomen addit film everi singl line dialogu charact build gener confront enhanc tension significantli ofcours get wit extraordinari product design scale due simplist set hard imagin lumet could done even better consid materi given due lumet technic expertis visual mood setter claustroph atmospher fantast energet act feel thriller drama set ofcours fact audienc know anyth case beforehand also help sinc viewer even compel follow discus use pictur know anyth case yet in end whether kid guilti shown quit irrelev film mainli messag interfer person prejudic term law everi charact howev display kind human reason think certain way even juror state relat kid question relationship son a one bestact film time combin fantast screenplay impecc direct depth charact develop character angri men doubt one greatest direct debut ever made,Positive
"12 Angry Men is a very entertaining film. It is full of great writing, directing, cinematography, and acting! Henry Fonda proves to be a very strong leading man. His performance here is flawless as a man trying to convince 11 other jurors about the possibility of a man's innocence. Lee J. Cobb is phenomenal, as well as E.G. Marshall. The twists and turns the film goes though are very absorbing, and when the film is done, you feel like you know every one of these characters very well. Sidney Lumet is a very talented director, he captures some very nice shots, and some very long shots that are powerful. 12 Angry Men is one of those rare black-and-white films that are actually very entertaining.",angri men entertain film it full great write direct cinematographi act henri fonda prove strong lead man hi perform flawless man tri convinc juror possibl man innoc lee j cobb phenomen well eg marshal the twist turn film goe though absorb film done feel like know everi one charact well sidney lumet talent director captur nice shot long shot power angri men one rare blackandwhit film actual entertain,Positive
"As a team of film critics, we recently went to the cinema to see a broadcast of the movie ""12 angry men"" and God, what a great film for octogenarians! Maybe to give you our opinion about it, we must put this dud into context.

12 angry men or ""12 hommes en colère"" in French, is a 1957 American courtroom drama film directed by Sidney Lumet and based on the eponymous piece of theatre of 1954 written by Reginald Rose. As Lumet is a filmmaker known for his tragedies and critics of American justice system, we were, as fans waiting for a harrowing masterpiece! But we think that our small introduction made you understand that we were disappointed.

The movie unfolds in a jury room in which 12 jurors are deliberating the case of an impoverished 18-year-old boy who is accused of stabbing his father to death. Therefore, the spectator follows this uneven trial for not less than ninety-six minutes, which is of course a bit exhausting. However, you may be pleased when seeing the cast with Henry Fonda, which would be normal. Yet, he probably is the reason of the movie's recognition, because there is nothing else that distinguishes it from other courtroom films such as Liar Liar from 1997. Maybe, we are scandalmongers because you probably know Martin Balsam? Or John Fiedler? No, you don't? To be honest we think that Fonda, Mr Davis in the movie, or the juror eight truly makes the film. If the gamechanger, the one who was about to save the young boy by rebelling against the tyranny of the majority, was anonymous for the spectators, would people give the movie that much attention? We do not think so. Nevertheless, the themes addressed in this film seemed intrusting: the justice and the question of morality and values are omnipresent, but they would be the few positive points. In fact, it contains an underlying message about prejudicial actions, the difficulties to be a juror and even racism during the fifties. It provides an interesting perspective on the importance of being a juror and the possible biases that jurors could, and still can encounter nowadays. It is both dramatic and tense, and it is insightful in its depiction of various aspects of humanity. But we were unable to identify with this film as it was impossible to identify with any of the jurors, it felt like they were not communicating any emotion.

Moreover, the script may seem ingenious but if you dig a bit it is not really the case and almost becomes boring at one point. It was so hard not to fall asleep while watching it. We were neither surprised nor excited to see the film and after we saw it. Don't you think the story is a bit far-fetched? Twelve brains take ninety minutes to agree on such an obvious case? Of course, he was not guilty. But after all, this movie kind of shows how screwed up the American justice system is. The poor boy is found guilty before all the evidence were even considered. Logic would dictate that he is not guilty until proven innocent, but apparently only one brain managed to take that detail into account, which made the scenario a bit inconceivable.

To be the most objective as possible, 12 angry men is one of the films that did not aged well. Overall, this is a good movie if you like vintage (because it is trending again), slow-paced, and closed-door films. You can also go see it if you like films that denounce timeless issues that still occur today. Also, if you like Henry Fonda, you want to watch it because he still plays greatly. It can be a great old school classic, but definitely a waste of time for people, like us from Generation Z. If you are into more dynamic courtroom movies, we would advice you to watch more recent ones, such as ""Just mercy"" from 2019 or ""the Trial of the Chicago 7"" that was released last year!",a team film critic recent went cinema see broadcast movi angri men god great film octogenarian mayb give opinion must put dud context angri men homm en colèr french american courtroom drama film direct sidney lumet base eponym piec theatr written reginald rose a lumet filmmak known tragedi critic american justic system fan wait harrow masterpiec but think small introduct made understand disappoint the movi unfold juri room juror deliber case impoverish yearold boy accus stab father death therefor spectat follow uneven trial less ninetysix minut cours bit exhaust howev may plea see cast henri fonda would normal yet probabl reason movi recognit noth el distinguish courtroom film liar liar mayb scandalmong probabl know martin balsam or john fiedler no dont to honest think fonda mr davi movi juror eight truli make film if gamechang one save young boy rebel tyranni major anonym spectat would peopl give movi much attent we think nevertheless theme address film seem intrust justic question moral valu omnipres would posit point in fact contain underli messag prejudici action difficulti juror even racism fifti it provid interest perspect import juror possibl bias juror could still encount nowaday it dramat ten insight depict variou aspect human but unabl identifi film imposs identifi juror felt like commun emot moreov script may seem ingeni dig bit realli case almost becom bore one point it hard fall asleep watch we neither surpris excit see film saw dont think stori bit farfetch twelv brain take nineti minut agre obviou case of cours guilti but movi kind show screw american justic system the poor boy found guilti evid even consid logic would dictat guilti proven innoc appar one brain manag take detail account made scenario bit inconceiv to object possibl angri men one film age well overal good movi like vintag trend slowpac closeddoor film you also go see like film denounc timeless issu still occur today also like henri fonda want watch still play greatli it great old school classic definit wast time peopl like u gener z if dynam courtroom movi would advic watch recent one just merci trial chicago releas last year,Positive
"12 Angry Men is the tailor-made type of movie that was common in the 1950s but has become non-existent today. It is all dialog, relies heavily on acting, and is short but sweet in its running time. All this adds up to one of the most satisfying watching experiences available in the movies. Henry Fonda plays a juror who has a ""reasonable doubt"" that the boy they are trying might not be guilty. From beginning to end, no matter who is standing against him, he continues to vote not guilty.

Slowly, but surely, Juror #8 begins to raise questions and doubts about the validity of the witnesses boy being and the evidence against the boy being accused of his father. Soon, more than just one juror thinks he may not be guilty, and this leads to some fantastic drama.

For this type of movie, the two most important issues were handled very well. The acting is top-notch all around, especially Fonda as the quiet, gentle man who sees something wrong with how most of the jury takes the evidence blindly. Lee J. Cobb also sticks out as Juror #3, a man with severe personal problems that tend to influence his decision. The script is tight but very good at exploring all areas of the judicial system and the stereotypes many of us have about it. All in all, this movie very openly discusses the importance of life and how when it hangs in the balance of a group of men's hands, it should not be rushed into but rather thought out and analyzed.

Sidney Lumet does an excellent job of pacing the movie and keeping the suspense all throughout right to the final shot. It isn't a movie everyone will enjoy, but for those who want something more out of their movies, 12 Angry Men says something and then some.
